    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. IN THE POLICE COURT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Te Assistant District Attorney glanced down at the papers in his hand and
      then up at the well-dressed, stockily built man occupying the witness
      stand. His manner was conciliatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to your testimony, Mr. Clymer, the prisoner, John Sylvester,
      was honest and reliable, and faithfully performed his duties as
      confidential clerk,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;Just when was Sylvester in your employ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvester was never in my employ,&rdquo; corrected Benjamin Augustus Clymer.
      The president of the Metropolis Trust Company was noted for his precision
      of speech. &ldquo;During the winter of 1918 I shared an apartment with Judge
      James Hildebrand, who employed Sylvester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Sylvester addicted to drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he quarrelsome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Sylvester married at that date?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the question a faint smile touched the corners of Clymer's clean shaven
      mouth and his eyes traveled involuntarily toward the over-dressed female
      whose charge of assault and battery against her husband had brought Clymer
      to the police court as a &ldquo;character&rdquo; witness in Sylvester's behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvester left Judge Hildebrand to get married,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;He was a
      model clerk; honest, sober, and industrious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, Mr. Clymer.&rdquo; The Assistant District Attorney spoke in some
      haste. &ldquo;You may retire, sir,&rdquo; and, as Clymer turned to vacate the witness
      box, he addressed the presiding judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clymer did not catch his remarks as, on stepping down, he was button-holed
      by a man whose entrance had occurred a few minutes before through the
      swing door which gave exit from the space reserved for witnesses and
      lawyers into the body of the court room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit over here a second,&rdquo; the newcomer said in an undertone, indicating
      the long bench under the window. &ldquo;Has Miss McIntyre been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre&mdash;here?&rdquo; Clymer stared in amazement at his questioner.
      &ldquo;No, certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so positive,&rdquo; retorted the lawyer heatedly, his color rising at
      the other's incredulous tone. &ldquo;Helen McIntyre telephoned me to meet her,
      and&mdash;by Jove, here she comes,&rdquo; as a slight stir at the back of the
      court room caused him to glance in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gray-haired patrolman, cap in hand, was in the lead of the small
      procession which filed up the aisle, and Clymer gazed in astonishment at
      Helen McIntyre and her twin sister, Barbara. What had brought them at that
      hour to the police court?
    </p>
    <p>
      The court room was filled with men, both white and black, while a dozen or
      more slatternly negro women were seated here and there. The Assistant
      District Attorney's plea for a postponement of the Sylvester case on the
      ground of the absence of an important witness and the granting of his plea
      was entirely lost on the majority of those in the court room, their
      attention being wholly centered on Helen McIntyre and Barbara, whose
      bearing and clothes spoke of a fashionable and prosperous world to which
      nearly all present were utterly foreign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, sensitive to the concentrated regard which their entrance had
      attracted, drew closer to Dr. Amos Stone, their family physician, who had
      accompanied them at her particular request. Except for Mrs. Sylvester, she
      and her sister were the only white women in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they could take the seats to which they had been ushered, the
      clerk's stentorian tones sent the girls' names echoing down the court room
      and Barbara, much perturbed, found herself standing with Helen before the
      clerk's desk. There was a moment's wait and the deputy marshal, who had
      motioned to one of the prisoners sitting in the &ldquo;cage&rdquo; to step outside,
      emphasized his order with a muttered imprecation to hurry. A slouching
      figure finally shambled past him and stopped some little distance from the
      group in front of the Judge's bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;House-breaking,&rdquo; announced the clerk. &ldquo;Charge brought by&mdash;&rdquo; He
      looked up at the two girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Helen McIntyre,&rdquo; answered one of the twins composedly. &ldquo;Daughter of
      Colonel Charles McIntyre of this city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charge brought by Miss Helen McIntyre,&rdquo; continued the clerk, &ldquo;against&mdash;&rdquo;
       and his pointed finger indicated the seedy looking man slouching before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; said the latter, and his husky voice was barely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; repeated the clerk. &ldquo;First name&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; was the answer, given after a slight pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Smith, you are charged by Miss Helen McIntyre with house-breaking.
      What say you&mdash;guilty or not guilty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shifted his weight from one foot to the other and shot an uneasy
      look about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant Helen caught sight of Benjamin Clymer and his companion,
      Philip Rochester, and her pale cheeks flushed faintly at the lawyer's
      approach. He had time but for a hasty handshake before the clerk
      administered the oath to the prisoner and the witnesses in the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rochester walked back and resumed his seat by Clymer. Propping himself in
      the corner made by the bench and the cage, inside of which sat the
      prisoners, he opened his right hand and unfolded a small paper. He read
      the brief penciled message it contained not once but a dozen times.
      Folding the paper into minute dimensions he tucked it carefully inside his
      vest pocket and glanced sideways at Clymer. The banker hardly noticed his
      uneasy movements as he sat regarding Helen McIntyre standing in the
      witness box. Although paler than usual, the girl's manner was quiet, but
      Clymer, a close student of human nature, decided she was keeping her
      composure by will power alone, and his interest grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge, from the Bench, was also regarding the handsome witness and the
      burglar with close attention. Colonel Charles McIntyre, a wealthy
      manufacturer, had, upon his retirement from active business, made the
      National Capital his home, and his name had become a household word for
      philanthropy, while his twin daughters were both popular in Washington's
      gay younger set. Several reporters of local papers, attracted by the
      mention of the McIntyre name, as well as by the twins' appearance, watched
      the scene with keen expectancy, eager for early morning &ldquo;copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Assistant District Attorney rose to question Helen McIntyre, the
      Judge addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the prisoner represented by counsel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For reply the burglar shook his head. Rising slowly to his feet, Philip
      Rochester advanced to the man's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it please the court,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I will take the case for the
      prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His offer received a quick acceptance from the Bench, but the scowl with
      which the burglar favored him was not pleasant. Hitching at his frayed
      flannel collar, the man partly turned his back on the lawyer and listened
      with a heavy frown to Helen's quick answers to the questions put to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While waiting for my sister to return from a dance early this morning,&rdquo;
       she stated, &ldquo;I went downstairs into the library, and as I entered it I saw
      a man slip across the room and into a coat closet. I retained enough
      presence of mind to steal across to the closet and turn the key in the
      door; then I ran to the window and fortunately saw Officer O'Ryan standing
      under the arc light across the street. I called him and he arrested the
      prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her simple statement evoked a nod of approval from the Assistant District
      Attorney, and Rochester frowned as he waived his right to cross-examine
      her. The next witness was Officer O'Ryan, and his testimony confirmed
      Helen's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prisoner was standing back among the coats in the closet,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;My automatic against his ribs brought him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you search your prisoner?&rdquo; asked Rochester, as he took the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find any concealed weapons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A burglar's kit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the prisoner make a statement after his arrest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he came along peaceably enough, hardly a word out of him,&rdquo;
       acknowledged O'Ryan regretfully. He enjoyed a reputation on the force as a
      &ldquo;scrapper,&rdquo; and a willing prisoner was a disappointment to his naturally
      pugnacious disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you search the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, and haven't I been telling you I did?&rdquo; answered O'Ryan; his pride
      in his achievement in arresting a burglar in so fashionable a neighborhood
      as Sheridan Circle was giving place to resentment at Rochester's manner of
      addressing him. At a sign from the lawyer, he left the witness stand, and
      Rochester addressed the Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask the indulgence of the court for more time,&rdquo; he commenced, &ldquo;that I
      may consult my client and find if he desires to call witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The court finds,&rdquo; responded the Judge, &ldquo;that a clear case of
      house-breaking has been proven against the prisoner by reputable
      witnesses. He will have to stand trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time the prisoner raised his eyes from contemplation of the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand trial by jury,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your right,&rdquo; acknowledged the Judge, and turned to consult his
      calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping forward, the deputy marshal laid his hand on the burglar's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go inside,&rdquo; he directed and held open the cage door, which immediately
      swung back into place, and Rochester, following closely at the prisoner's
      heels, halted abruptly. A fit of coughing shook the burglar and he paused
      by the iron railing, gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; he pleaded, and a court attendant handed a cup to Rochester,
      standing just outside the cage, and he passed it over the iron railing to
      the burglar. Then turning on his heel the lawyer rejoined Clymer, his
      discontent plainly discernible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clear case against your client,&rdquo; remarked Clymer, reading his thoughts.
      &ldquo;Don't take the affair to heart, man; you did your best under
      difficulties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rochester shook his head gloomily. &ldquo;I might have&mdash;Jove! why didn't I
      ask for bail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bail!&rdquo; The banker suppressed a chuckle as he eyed the threadbare suit and
      tattered appearance of the burglar, who had resumed his seat in the
      prisoner's cage. &ldquo;Who would have stood surety for that scarecrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have.&rdquo; Rochester spoke with some vehemence, but his words were
      partly drowned by the violent fit of coughing which again shook the
      burglar, and before he could finish his sentence, Helen McIntyre stood at
      his elbow. She bowed gravely to Clymer who rose at her approach, and laid
      a persuasive hand on Rochester's sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come with us?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Barbara and Dr. Stone are ready to
      leave. The doctor wishes to&mdash;&rdquo; As she spoke she looked across at
      Stone, who stood opposite her in the little group. He failed to catch both
      her word and her eye, his gaze, passing over her shoulder, was riveted on
      the burglar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is wrong,&rdquo; he announced and pushed past Barbara. &ldquo;Let me inside
      the cage,&rdquo; he directed as the deputy marshal kept the gate closed at his
      approach. &ldquo;Your prisoner appears ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One glance at the burglar proved the truth of the physician's statement
      and the gate was hastily opened. Stone bent over the man, whose spasmodic
      breathing could be heard distinctly through the court room, then his gaze
      shifted to the other occupants of the cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man must have air,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Your aid here.&rdquo; Looking up his eyes
      met Clymer's, and the latter came swiftly into the cage, followed by
      Rochester, and the deputy marshal slammed the door shut behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step out this way,&rdquo; he said, as Clymer aided the physician in lifting the
      burglar, and he led them into the ante-room whence prisoners were taken
      into the cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretching his burden on the floor, Stone tore open the man's shirt and
      felt his heart, while Clymer, spying a water cooler, sped across the room
      and returned immediately with a brimming glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's water,&rdquo; he said, but Stone refused the proffered glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The man is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; echoed the deputy marshal. &ldquo;Well, I'll be&mdash;say, doctor,&rdquo; but
      Stone had darted out of the room, and he turned open-mouthed to Clymer.
      &ldquo;If it wasn't Doctor Stone I would say he was crazy,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! Feel the man's heart and convince yourself,&rdquo; suggested Clymer
      tartly, and the deputy marshal, dropping on one knee, did so. Detecting no
      heart-beat, the officer passed his hand over the dead man's unshaven chin
      and across his forehead, brushing back the unkempt hair. Under his none
      too gentle touch the wig slipped back, revealing to his astonished gaze a
      head of short cropped, red hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clymer, who had followed the deputy marshal's movements with interest,
      gave a shout which was echoed by Rochester and Dr. Stone, who returned at
      that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; gasped Clymer, shaken out of his accustomed calm. &ldquo;Jimmie
      Turnbull!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deputy marshal eyed the startled men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Dr. Stone straightened the dead man and removed the wig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James Turnbull,&rdquo; he said gravely, and turning, addressed Rochester, who
      had dropped down on the nearest chair. &ldquo;Cashier of the Metropolis Trust
      Company, Rochester, and your roommate, masquerading as a burglar.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE GAME OF CONSEQUENCES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rochester did not appear to hear Dr. Stone's words. With eyes half
      starting from their sockets he sat staring at the dead man, completely
      oblivious of the others' presence. After watching him for a moment the
      physician turned briskly to the dazed deputy marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Summon the coroner,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;We cannot move the body until he
      comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His curt tone brought the official's wits back with a jump and he made for
      the exit, only to be stopped at the threshold by a sandy-haired man just
      entering the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word coroner, Rochester raised himself from his bent attitude and
      brushed his hand across his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need for a coroner to diagnose the case,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;Poor Turnbull
      always said he would go off like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone moved nearer. &ldquo;Like that?&rdquo; he questioned, pointing to the still
      figure. &ldquo;Explain yourself, Rochester. Did Turnbull expect to die here in
      this manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;certainly not.&rdquo; The lawyer moistened his dry lips. &ldquo;But
      when a man has angina pectoris he knows the end may come at any moment and
      in any place. Turnbull made no secret of suffering from that disease.&rdquo;
       Rochester turned toward Clymer. &ldquo;You knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin Clymer, who had been gazing alternately at the dead man and
      vaguely about the room, looked startled at the abrupt question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew Turnbull had bad attacks of the heart; we all knew it at the
      bank,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;But I understood the disease had responded to
      treatment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no cure for angina pectoris,&rdquo; declared Rochester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No permanent cure,&rdquo; amended Stone, and would have added more, but
      Rochester stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you know Turnbull died of angina pectoris there is no necessity
      of sending for the coroner,&rdquo; Rochester spoke in haste, his words tumbling
      over each other. &ldquo;I will go at once and communicate with an undertaker.&rdquo;
       But before he could rise from his chair the sandy-haired man, who had
      conducted a whispered conversation with the deputy marshal, advanced
      toward the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, and turned back a lapel of his coat
      and displayed a metal badge. &ldquo;I am Ferguson of the Central Office. Do you
      know the deceased?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was my intimate friend,&rdquo; announced Rochester before his companions
      could reply to the detective's question, which was addressed to all. &ldquo;Mr.
      Clymer, here, can tell you that Jimmie Turnbull, cashier of his bank, was
      well known in financial and social Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came he here in this fix?&rdquo; asked Ferguson with more force than
      grammatic clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sudden heart attack&mdash;angina pectoris, you know,&rdquo; replied Rochester
      glibly, &ldquo;with fatal results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't alluding to what killed him,&rdquo; Ferguson explained. &ldquo;But why was
      the cashier of the Metropolis Trust Company,&rdquo; he looked questioningly at
      Clymer whom he knew quite well by sight, &ldquo;and a social high-light, decked
      out in these clothes and a wig, too?&rdquo; leaning down, the better to examine
      the clothing on the dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had just been held for the Grand Jury on a charge of house-breaking,&rdquo;
       volunteered the deputy marshal. &ldquo;I reckon that brought on his
      heart-attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; agreed Rochester. &ldquo;The excitement was too much for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;House-breaking&rdquo; ejaculated the detective. &ldquo;Dangerous sport for a man
      suffering with angina pectoris, aside from anything else. Who preferred
      charges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Misses McIntyre,&rdquo; answered the deputy marshal, to whom the question
      was addressed. &ldquo;Like to interview them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Rochester was on his feet instantly. &ldquo;There is no necessity to
      bring the twins out here&mdash;it's too tragic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tragic?&rdquo; echoed Ferguson. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;Turnbull was arrested in their house,&rdquo; Rochester was
      commencing to stutter. &ldquo;He was their friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught burglarizing, heh?&rdquo; Ferguson's eyes glowed; the case already
      whetted his remarkably keen inquisitorial instinct which had gained him
      place and certain fame in the Washington police force. &ldquo;Are the Misses
      McIntyre still in the building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were in the court room just before we brought Turnbull's body here,&rdquo;
       responded the deputy marshal. &ldquo;I guess they are still waiting, eh,
      doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone, thus appealed to, nodded. &ldquo;I agree with Mr. Rochester,&rdquo; he said,
      and the gravity of his manner impressed Ferguson. &ldquo;It is better for me to
      break the news of Mr. Turnbull's death to the young ladies before bringing
      them here. Therefore, with your permission, Ferguson&rdquo;&mdash;He got no
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the outer entrance of the room came Helen McIntyre and her sister
      Barbara, conducted by the same bowing patrolman who had ushered them into
      the court room an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Too late!&rdquo; stammered Rochester under his breath, and he turned in
      desperation to Benjamin Clymer. The bank president's state of mind at the
      extraordinary masquerade and sudden death of his popular and trusted
      cashier bordered on shocked horror, which had made him a passive witness
      of the rapidly shifting scene. Rochester clutched his arm in his
      agitation. &ldquo;Get the twins out of here&mdash;do something, man! Don't you
      know that Turnbull was in love with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fervid whisper penetrated further than he realized and one of the
      McIntyre twins looked inquiringly in their direction. Clymer, more
      startled than his demeanor indicated, wondered if she had overheard
      Rochester's ejaculations, but whatever action the banker contemplated in
      response to the lawyer's appeal was checked by a scream from the girl on
      his right. With ashen face and trembling finger she pointed to Turnbull's
      body which suddenly confronted her as she walked forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Babs, tell me!&rdquo; And she held out her hand
      imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister stepped to her side and bent over Turnbull. When she looked up
      her lips alone retained their color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she implored, giving her sister a slight shake. &ldquo;Hush! It is
      Jimmie Turnbull. Can you not see for yourself, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed doubtful if Helen heard her; with attention wholly centered on
      the dead man she swayed on her feet, and Dr. Stone, thinking she was about
      to fall, placed a supporting arm about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know Jimmie?&rdquo; asked her sister. &ldquo;Don't stare so, dearest.&rdquo; Her
      tone was pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the young lady has some difficulty in recognizing Mr. Turnbull in
      his disguise,&rdquo; suggested Ferguson, who stood somewhat in the background
      but closely observing the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disguise!&rdquo; Helen raised her eyes and Ferguson, hardened as he had become
      to tragic scenes, felt a throb of pity as he caught the pent-up agony in
      her mute appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss,&rdquo; he said awkwardly. &ldquo;The burglar you caught in your house was
      Mr. Turnbull in disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara McIntyre released her grasp of her sister's arm and collapsed on a
      chair. Stone, still supporting Helen, felt her muscles grow taut and an
      instant later she stepped back from his side and stood by her sister. As
      the two girls faced the circle of men, the likeness between them was
      extraordinary. Each had the same slight graceful figure, equal height; and
      feature for feature, coloring matching coloring, they were identical;
      their gowns, even, were cut on similar lines, only their hats varied in
      shape and color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand, gentlemen,&rdquo; Helen began, and her voice gained steadiness
      as she proceeded, &ldquo;that the burglar whom Officer O'Ryan and I caught
      lurking in our house was James Turnbull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; answered Ferguson, and Stone, as the twins looked dumbly at him,
      confirmed the detective's statement with a brief, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence that ensued was broken by Barbara rising to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie won his wager,&rdquo; she announced. Her gaze did not waver before the
      concentrated regard of the men facing her. &ldquo;He broke into our house&mdash;but,
      oh, how can I pay my debt to him now that he is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Helen laid a cautioning hand on her sister's arm as the latter's
      voice gained in shrillness, the shrillness of approaching hysteria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am all right, Helen.&rdquo; Barbara waved her away impatiently. &ldquo;What caused
      Jimmie's death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angina pectoris,&rdquo; declared Rochester. &ldquo;Too much excitement brought on a
      fatal attack.&rdquo; Barbara nodded dazedly. &ldquo;I knew he had heart trouble, but&mdash;&rdquo;
       She stepped toward Turnbull and her voice quivered with feeling. &ldquo;Don't
      leave Jimmie lying there; take him to his room, doctor,&rdquo; turning
      entreatingly to Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician looked at her compassionately. &ldquo;I will, just as soon as the
      coroner views the body,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;But come away now, Babs; this is no
      place for you and Helen.&rdquo; He signed to the deputy marshal to open the door
      as he walked across the room, Barbara keeping step with him, and her
      sister following in their wake. At the door Barbara paused and looked
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there be an inquest?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's for the coroner to decide,&rdquo; responded Ferguson. &ldquo;As long as Mr.
      Turnbull entered your house on a wager and died from an attack of angina
      pectoris the inquest is likely to be a mere formality. Ah, here is the
      coroner now,&rdquo; as a man paused in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen McIntyre moved back from the door to make room for Coroner Penfield.
      Having had occasion to attend court that morning, he was passing the door
      when attracted by the group just inside the room. Courteously
      acknowledging Helen's act, Penfield stepped briskly across the threshold
      and stopped abruptly on catching sight of the lonely figure on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you hold an autopsy, Ferguson?&rdquo; asked Clymer, breaking his long
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, we never do when the cause of death is apparent,&rdquo; the detective
      bowed to Coroner Penfield. &ldquo;Isn't that so, Coroner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield nodded. &ldquo;Unless the condition of the body indicates foul play or
      the relatives specially request it, we do not perform autopsies,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;What has happened here?&rdquo; and he gazed about with quickened
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull, who masqueraded as a burglar on a wager with Miss McIntyre
      died suddenly from angina pectoris,&rdquo; explained the deputy marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a case of death from natural causes,&rdquo; broke in Rochester. &ldquo;Please
      write out a permit for me to remove Turnbull's body, Dr. Penfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen McIntyre took a step forward. Her eyes, twice their accustomed size,
      shone brightly, in contrast to her dead white face. Carefully avoiding her
      sister's glance she addressed the coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must insist,&rdquo; she began and stopped to control her voice. &ldquo;As Mr.
      Turnbull's fiancee, I&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered again. &ldquo;I demand that an
      autopsy be held to determine the cause of his death.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE ROOM WITH THE SEVEN DOORS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster regarded her surroundings with inward satisfaction. It would
      have taken a far more captious critic than the pretty widow to find fault
      with the large, high-ceilinged room in which she sat. The handsome carved
      Venetian furniture, the rich hangings and valuable paintings on the walls
      gave evidence of Colonel McIntyre's artistic taste and appreciation of the
      beautiful. Mrs. Brewster had never failed, during her visit to the
      McIntyre twins, to examine the rare curios in the carved cabinets and the
      tapestries on the walls, but that afternoon, with one eye on the clock and
      the other on her embroidery, she sat waiting in growing impatience for the
      interruption she anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of the clock had passed the hour of five before the buzz of a
      distant bell brought her to her feet. Hurrying to the window she peeped
      between the curtains in time to see a stylish roadster electric glide down
      the driveway leading from the McIntyre residence and stop at the curb. As
      she turned to go back to her chair Dr. Stone was ushered into the library
      by the footman. Mrs. Brewster welcomed her cousin with frank relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have waited so impatiently for you,&rdquo; she confessed, making room for him
      to sit on the sofa by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was detained, Margaret.&rdquo; Stone's voice was not over-cordial; three
      imperative telephone calls from her, coming at a moment when he had been
      engaged with a serious case in his office, had provoked him. &ldquo;Do you wish
      to see me professionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I don't.&rdquo; She laughed frankly. &ldquo;I am the picture of health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone, observing her fine coloring and clear eyes, silently agreed with
      her. The widow made a charming picture in her modish tea-gown, and the
      physician, watching her with an appraising eye, acknowledged the beauty
      which had captivated all Washington. Mrs. Brewster had carried her honors
      tactfully, a fact which had gained her popularity even among the dowagers
      and match-making mothers who take an active part in Washington's social
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Margaret, what do you wish to see me about?&rdquo; Stone asked, after
      waiting without result for her to continue speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed softly. &ldquo;You are the most practical of men,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
      would not have been so difficult to find a companion anxious to spend the
      whole afternoon with me for my sake alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre, for instance?&rdquo; he teased, and laughed amusedly at her
      heightened color. &ldquo;Have a care, Margaret; McIntyre's flirtations are all
      very well, but he is the type of man to be deadly in earnest when once he
      falls in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for your warning,&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster smiled, then grew serious. &ldquo;I
      sent for you to ask about Jimmie Turnbull's death this morning. Barbara
      told me you accompanied them to the police court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why weren't you with the girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was told nothing of their trip to the police court until they
      had returned,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;How horribly tragic the whole affair is!&rdquo; And
      a shiver she could not suppress crept down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed Stone. &ldquo;What possessed Jimmie Turnbull to play so mad a
      trick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wager with Barbara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone leaned a little nearer. &ldquo;Have you learned the nature of that wager?&rdquo;
       he asked, lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Babs was in so hysterical a condition when she returned from the
      police court that she gave a very incoherent account of the whole affair,
      and she has kept her room ever since luncheon,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone looked puzzled. &ldquo;I understood that Jimmie was attentive to Helen
      McIntyre and not to Barbara,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But upon my word, Barbara appeared
      more overcome by Jimmie's death than Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster did not reply at once; instead, she glanced carefully
      around. The room was generally the rallying place of the McIntyres. It
      stretched across almost the entire width of the house; the diamond-paned
      and recessed windows gave it a medieval air in keeping with its antique
      furniture, and the seven doors opening from it led, respectively, to the
      large dining room beyond, a morning room, billiard room, the front and
      back halls, and the Italian loggia which over-looked the stretch of ground
      between the McIntyre residence and its neighbor on the north. Apparently,
      she and Dr. Stone had the room to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot answer your question with positiveness,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;Frankly,
      Jimmie appeared impartial in his attentions to the twins. When he wasn't
      with Barbara he was with Helen, and vice versa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone gazed at her in some perplexity. &ldquo;Are you aware that Helen stated at
      the police court this morning that she was Turnbull's fiancee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster actually bounced in her seat. &ldquo;You&mdash;you astound
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a bit surprised myself,&rdquo; acknowledged the physician. &ldquo;I thought
      Rochester&mdash;however, that is neither here nor there. Helen not only
      announced she was Jimmie's fiancee but as such demanded that a post-mortem
      examination be held to determine the cause of his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster's pretty color faded and the glance she turned on her cousin
      was sharp. &ldquo;Why should Helen suspect foul play?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;For that
      is what her request hinted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True.&rdquo; Stone pulled his beard absentmindedly. &ldquo;Ah, here is Colonel
      McIntyre,&rdquo; he exclaimed as the portieres before the hall door parted and a
      tall man strode into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre was a favorite with the old physician, and he welcomed his
      arrival with warmth. Exchanging a word of greeting with Mrs. Brewster,
      McIntyre drew up a chair and dropped into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called at your office, doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Went there at once on
      learning the shocking news about poor Turnbull. Why in the world didn't he
      announce who he was when my daughter had him arrested as a burglar? He
      must have realized that prolonged excitement was bad for his weak heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster, who had settled herself more comfortably in her corner of
      the sofa on McIntyre's arrival, answered his remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only knew Jimmie superficially,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but he had one
      distinguishing trait patent to all, his inordinate fondness for practical
      jokes. Probably the predicament he found himself in was highly to his
      taste&mdash;until his heart failed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, slightly raised, carried across the room and reached the ears
      of a tall, slender girl who had stood hesitating on the threshold of the
      dining worn door on beholding the group by the sofa. All hesitation
      vanished, however, as the meaning of Mrs. Brewster's remark dawned on her,
      and she walked over to the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very unjust, Margaret,&rdquo; she stated, and at sound of her low
      triante voice McIntyre whirled around and frowned slightly. &ldquo;Jimmie was
      thinking of the predicament of others, not of himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Helen?&rdquo; her father demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how could Jimmie reveal his identity in court without involving us?&rdquo;
       she asked. &ldquo;Good afternoon, doctor,&rdquo; recollecting her manners, and her
      attention thus diverted, she missed the sudden questioning look which Mrs.
      Brewster and her father exchanged. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;Jimmie sacrificed
      himself for others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By becoming a burglar.&rdquo; McIntyre laughed shortly. &ldquo;Don't talk arrant
      nonsense, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl flushed at his tone, and Dr. Stone, an interested onlooker,
      marveled at the fleeting flash of disdain which lighted her dark eyes.
      Stone's interest grew. The McIntyre family had always been particularly
      congenial, and the devotion of Colonel McIntyre (left a widower when the
      twins were in short frocks) to his daughters had been commented on
      frequently by their wide circle of friends in Washington and by
      acquaintances made in their travels abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre had married when quite a young man. Frugality and
      industry and a brilliant mind had reaped their reward, and, wiser than the
      majority of Americans, he retired early from business and devoted himself
      to a life of leisure and the education of his daughters. Their debut the
      previous autumn had been one of the social events of the Washington
      season, and the instant popularity the girls had attained proved a source
      of pride to Colonel McIntyre. His chief pleasure consisted in gratifying
      their every whim, and Dr. Stone, knowing the family as he did, wondered at
      the faintly discernible air of constraint in the girl's manner. Usually
      frank to a sometimes embarrassing degree, she appeared to some
      disadvantage as she sat gazing moodily at the tips of her patent-leather
      pumps. Dr. Stone's attention shifted to Colonel McIntyre and lastly to the
      pretty widow at his elbow. Had Dame Rumor spoken truly in the report,
      widely circulated, that the colonel had fallen a victim to the charms of
      Margaret Brewster, his daughters' guest? If so, it might account for the
      young girl's manner&mdash;however devoted McIntyre's daughters might be to
      Mrs. Brewster as a friend and companion, they might resent having so young
      a woman for their step-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not receiving any reply to his remarks, McIntyre was about to address his
      daughter again when she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie will be justified,&rdquo; she declared stoutly. &ldquo;Has the coroner held
      the autopsy yet, Dr. Stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Autopsy!&rdquo; McIntyre spoke with sharp abruptness. &ldquo;I thought it was clearly
      established that Jimmie died from angina pectoris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so believed,&rdquo; responded Stone. His mystification was growing; had
      not Helen informed her father of the scene which had transpired at the
      police court, and of her request to the coroner? &ldquo;I understand the
      post-mortem examination will be made this afternoon, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy paper knife, nicely balanced between McIntyre's well manicured
      fingers, dropped to the floor as a step sounded behind him and the butler,
      Grimes, stopped by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rochester just telephoned that his partner, Mr. Harry Kent, is out of
      town, Miss&rdquo;&mdash;bowing to the silent girl. Grimes always contented
      himself with addressing his &ldquo;young ladies&rdquo; by the simple prefix &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo;
       and never added their given names, because, as he expressed it, &ldquo;them
      twins are alike as two peas, and which is which, I dunno.&rdquo; Considering
      himself one of the family from his long service with Colonel McIntyre, he
      kept a watchful eye on the twins, but their pranks in childhood had often
      exasperated him into giving notice, which he generally found it convenient
      to forget when the first of a new month came around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kent will be back to-morrow,&rdquo; added the butler, as silence followed
      the delivery of his message. &ldquo;Mr. Rochester wishes to know if he can
      transact any business for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please thank him and say no.&rdquo; The girl's color rose as she caught her
      father's disapproving look. The colonel waited until the butler had
      disappeared before addressing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you send for Harry Kent?&rdquo; he questioned. &ldquo;You know I do not
      approve of his attentions to Barbara. Rochester is well enough&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of Rochester&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Brewster saw the gathering storm clouds
      in the girl's expressive eyes, and broke hastily into the conversation. &ldquo;I
      see by the paper, Cousin Amos&rdquo;&mdash;she turned so as to face Dr. Stone&mdash;
      &ldquo;that Mr. Rochester declared positively that Jimmie Turnbull died from
      angina pectoris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's Philip's opinion worth?&rdquo; The young girl smiled disdainfully.
      &ldquo;Philip seems to think that having shared an apartment with Jimmie, gives
      him intimate knowledge of Jimmie's health. Philip is not a medical man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; acknowledged her father. &ldquo;But here is a medical man who was on the
      spot when Jimmie died. What's your opinion, Stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone, suddenly conscious of the keen attention of his companions, spoke
      slowly as was his wont when making a serious statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rochester's contention that Jimmie died from angina pectoris would seem
      borne out by what transpired,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Undoubtedly Jimmie felt an attack
      coming on and used the customary remedy to relieve it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was that remedy?&rdquo; questioned Mrs. Brewster swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amyl nitrite.&rdquo; Stone spoke with decision. &ldquo;I could detect its presence by
      the fruity, pleasant odor which always accompanies the drug's use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The exclamation slipped from Mrs. Brewster. &ldquo;Is the drug
      administered in water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is inhaled&mdash;take care, you have dropped your handkerchief.&rdquo;
       Stone pulled himself up short in his speech, and bent over but the young
      girl was too quick for him, and stooped first to pick up her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she raised her head Stone caught sight of the tiny mole under the lobe
      of her left ear. It was the one mark which distinguished Barbara from her
      twin sister. Colonel McIntyre had addressed his daughter as Helen, and she
      had not undeceived him&mdash;Why? The perplexed physician gave up the
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The drug,&rdquo; he went on to explain, &ldquo;amyl nitrite comes in pearl capsules
      and is crushed in a handkerchief and the fumes inhaled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster leaned forward suddenly. &ldquo;Would that cause death?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone shook his head in denial. &ldquo;Not the customary dose of three minims,&rdquo;
       he answered, and turning, found that Barbara had stolen from the room.

      CHAPTER IV. BARBARA ENGAGES COUNSEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bidding a hasty good morning to the elevator girl, Harry Kent, suit-case
      in hand, entered the cage and was carried up to the fourth floor of the
      Wilkins Building. Several business acquaintances stopped to chat with him
      as he walked down the corridor to his office, and it was fully fifteen
      minutes before he turned the knob of the door bearing the firm name&mdash;ROCHESTER
      AND KENT, ATTORNEYS&mdash;on its glass panel. As he stepped inside the
      anteroom which separated the two offices occupied respectively by him and
      his senior partner, Philip Rochester, a stranger rose from the clerk's
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir?&rdquo; he asked interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent eyed him in surprise. &ldquo;Mr. Rochester here?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. It am in charge of the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are!&rdquo; Kent's surprise increased. &ldquo;I happen to be Mr. Kent, junior
      partner in this firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir.&rdquo; The dapper clerk bowed and hurrying to his desk
      took up a letter. &ldquo;Mr. Rochester left this for you, Mr. Kent, before his
      departure last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His departure!&rdquo; Kent deposited his suit-case on one of the chairs and
      tore open the envelope. The note was a scrawl, which he had some
      difficulty in deciphering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Kent,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;Am called out of town; will be back Saturday.
      Saunders gave me some of his cheek this afternoon, so I fired him. I
      engaged John Sylvester to fill his place, who comes highly recommended. He
      will report for work to-morrow. Ta-ta&mdash;PHIL.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent thrust the note into his pocket and picked up his suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Rochester states that he has engaged you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your references&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, sir.&rdquo; The clerk handed him a folded paper, and Kent ran his eyes
      down the sheet from the sentence: &ldquo;To whom it may concern&rdquo; to the
      signature, Clark Hildebrand. The statement spoke in high terms of John
      Sylvester, confidential clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can refer you to my other employers, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; Sylvester volunteered
      as the young lawyer stood regarding the paper. &ldquo;If you, desire further
      information there is Mr. Clymer and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Judge Hildebrand's recommendation is sufficient.&rdquo; And at Kent's smile
      the clerk's anxious expression vanished. &ldquo;Did Mr. Rochester give you any
      outline of the work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; he told me to file the papers in the Hitchcock case, and attend
      to the morning correspondence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Has any one called this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. These letters were addressed to you personally, and I have not
      opened them,&rdquo; Sylvester handed a neatly arranged package to Kent. &ldquo;These,&rdquo;
       indicating several letters lying open on his desk, &ldquo;are to the firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring them to me in half an hour,&rdquo; and Kent walked into his private
      office, carefully closing the door behind him. Opening his suit-case he
      took out his brief bag and laid it on the desk in front of him together
      with the package of letters. Instead of opening the letters immediately,
      he tilted back in his chair and regarded the opposite wall in deep
      thought. Philip Rochester could not have selected a worse time to absent
      himself; three important cases were on the calendar for immediate trial
      and much depended on the firm's successful handling of them. Kent swore
      softly under his breath; his last warning to Rochester, that he would
      dissolve their partnership if the older man continued to neglect his
      practice, had been given only a month before and upon Kent's return from
      eight months' service in the Judge Advocate General's Department in
      France. Apparently his warning had fallen on deaf ears and Rochester was
      indulging in another periodic spree, for so Kent concluded, recalling the
      unsteady penmanship of the note handed to him by the new clerk, John
      Sylvester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was still frowning at the opposite wall when a faint knock sounded,
      and at his call Sylvester entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the letters received this morning, sir, and type-written copies
      of the answers to yesterday's correspondence which Mr. Rochester dictated
      before leaving,&rdquo; Sylvester explained as he placed the papers on Kent's
      desk. &ldquo;If you will o.k. them, I will mail them at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent went through the letters with care, and the new clerk rose in his
      estimation as he read the excellent dictation of the clearly typed
      answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These will do admirably,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Sit down and I will reply to the
      other letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an hour Sylvester closed his stenographic note book and
      collected the correspondence, by that time scattered over Kent's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have these notes ready for your signature before lunch,&rdquo; he said as
      he picked up a newspaper from the floor where it had tumbled during Kent's
      search for some particular letter heads. &ldquo;I brought in the morning paper,
      sir; thought perhaps you had not seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Kent swung his chair nearer the window and opened the newspaper.
      He had purchased a copy when walking through Union Station on his arrival,
      but had left it in the cafeteria where he had snatched a cup of coffee and
      hot rolls before hurrying to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read a column devoted to international affairs, scanned an account of a
      senatorial wrangle, and was about to turn to the second page, whistling
      cheerily, when his attention was arrested by the headings:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     BANK CASHIER DIES IN POLICE COURT
    JAMES TURNBULL, MISTAKEN FOR BURGLAR,
   SUFFERS FATAL ATTACK OF ANGINA PECTORIS
</pre>
    <p>
      Kent's whistle stopped abruptly, and clutching the paper in both hands, he
      devoured the short account printed under the scare heads:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;While masquerading as a burglar on a wager,
   James Turnbull, cashier of the Metropolis Trust
   Company, was arrested by Officer O'Ryan at an
   early hour yesterday morning in the residence of
   Colonel Charles McIntyre.

  &ldquo;Officer O'Ryan conducted his prisoner to the
   8th Precinct Police Station, and later he was
   arraigned in the police court.  The Misses
   McIntyre appeared in person to prefer the
   charges against the supposed burglar, who, on
   being sworn, gave the name of John Smith.

  &ldquo;Philip Rochester, the well known criminal
   lawyer, was assigned by the court to defend the
   prisoner.  Upon the evidence submitted Judge
   Mackall held the prisoner for trial by the grand
   jury.

  &ldquo;It was just after the Judge's announcement
   that 'John Smith,' then sitting in the prisoners
   cage, was seized with the attack of angina pectoris
   which ended so fatally a few minutes later.
   It was not until after he had expired that those
   rendering him medical assistance became aware
   that he was James Turnbull in disguise.

  &ldquo;James Turnbull was a native of Washington,
   his father, the late Hon Josiah Turnbull of
   Connecticut, having made this city his permanent
   home in the early '90s.  Mr. Turnbull was looked
   upon as one of the rising young men in banking
   circles; he was also prominent socially, was a
   member of the Alibi, Metropolitan, and Country
   Clubs, and until recently was active in all forms
   of athletics, when his ill-health precluded active
   exercise.

  &ldquo;Officer O'Ryan, who was greatly shocked by
   the fatal termination to Mr. Turnbull's rash
   wager, stated to the representatives of the press
   that Mr. Turnbull gave no hint of his identity
   while being interrogated at the 8th Precinct
   Station.  Friends attribute Mr. Turnbull's
   disinclination to reveal himself to the court, to
   his enjoyment of a practical joke, not realizing
   that the resultant excitement of the scene would
   react on his weak heart.

  &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull is survived by a great aunt; he had
   no nearer relatives living.  It is a singular
   coincidence that the lawyer appointed by the
   court to defend Turnbull was his intimate friend,
   Philip Rochester, who made his home with the
   deceased.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Kent read the column over and over, then, letting the paper slip to the
      floor, sat back in his chair, too dumb-founded for words. Jimmie Turnbull
      arrested as a burglar in the home of the girl he loved on charges
      preferred by her, and defended in court by his intimate friend, both of
      whom were unaware of his identity! Kent rumpled his fair hair until it
      stood upright. And Jimmie's death had followed almost immediately as the
      result of over-excitement!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent's eyes grew moist; he had been very fond of the eccentric, lovable
      bank cashier, whose knack of performing many a kindly act, unsolicited,
      had endeared him to friends and acquaintances alike. Kent had seen much of
      him after his return from France, for Jimmie's attention to Helen McIntyre
      had been only second to Kent's devotion to the latter's sister, Barbara.
      The two men had one bond in common. Colonel McIntyre disliked them and
      discouraged their calling, to the secret fury of both, but love had found
      a way&mdash;Kent's eyes kindled at the recollection of Barbara's half-shy,
      wholly tender reception of his ardent pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turnbull's courtship had met with a set-back where he had least expected
      it&mdash;Philip Rochester had fallen deeply in love with Helen and,
      encouraged by her father, had pressed his suit with ardor. Frequent
      quarrels between the two close friends had been the outcome, and Jimmie
      had confided to Kent, before the latter left on the business trip to
      Chicago from which he had returned that morning, that the situation had
      become intolerable and he had notified Rochester that he would no longer
      share his apartment with him, and to look for other quarters as quickly as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      So buried was Kent in his thoughts that he never heard Sylvester's knock,
      and it was not until the clerk stood at his elbow that he awoke from his
      absorption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady to see you, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Shall I show her in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave none.&rdquo; Sylvester paused on his way back to the door. &ldquo;It is one
      of the Misses McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; Kent was on his feet, straightening his tie and brushing his
      rumpled hair. &ldquo;Here, wait a minute&rdquo;&mdash;clutching a whisk broom in a
      frantic endeavor to remove some of the signs of travel which still clung
      to him. But he had only opportunity for one dab at his left shoulder
      before Barbara entered the office. All else forgotten, Kent tossed down
      the whisk broom and the next instant he had clasped her hand in both of
      his, his eyes telling more eloquently than his stumbling words, his joy at
      seeing her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a business call,&rdquo; she stated demurely, &ldquo;on you and Mr.
      Rochester.&rdquo; Her lovely eyes held a glint of mischief as she mentioned
      Kent's partner, then her expression grew serious. &ldquo;I want legal advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to put up with me,&rdquo; Kent moved his chair closer
      to the one she had selected by the desk. &ldquo;Rochester is out of town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Barbara sat bolt upright. &ldquo;Where&mdash;where's he gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&rdquo;&mdash;Kent pulled Rochester's letter out of his pocket and
      re-read it. &ldquo;He did not mention where he was going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara stared at him; she had paled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did Philip leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, I presume.&rdquo; Kent tipped back his chair and pressed a buzzer;
      a second later Sylvester appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Rochester tell you where he was going?&rdquo; he asked the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Mr. Rochester stated that you had his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; Kent concealed his growing surprise. &ldquo;Did he leave any message for
      me, other than the letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour did he leave the office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say, sir; he was still here when I went away at five o'clock. He
      gave me a key to the office so that I could get in this morning.&rdquo; Kent
      remained silent, and he added, &ldquo;Is that all, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thanks,&rdquo; and the clerk retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed Barbara turned to Kent. &ldquo;Have you heard about Jimmie
      Turnbull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was a bit breathless as she put the question, but Kent, puzzling
      over his partner's eccentric conduct, hardly noted her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I saw the account just now in the morning paper,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;A
      shocking affair. Poor Turnbull! He was a good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was!&rdquo; Barbara spoke with unaccustomed vehemence, and looking at her
      Kent saw that her eyes were filled with tears. Impulsively he threw his
      arm about her, holding her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart's dearest,&rdquo; he murmured fondly. &ldquo;If there is anything&mdash;anything
      I can do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara straightened up and winked away the tears. &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; she said
      tersely. &ldquo;Investigate Jimmie's death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent gazed at her in astonishment. &ldquo;Please explain,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;The
      morning paper states very plainly that the cause of death was an attack of
      angina pectoris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, and that is what Philip Rochester contends also.&rdquo; Barbara
      paused and glanced about the office; they had the room to themselves.
      &ldquo;B-but Helen believes otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent drew back. &ldquo;What do you mean, Babs?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; Barbara spoke wearily, and Kent, giving her close attention,
      grew aware of dark shadows under her eyes which told plainly of a
      sleepless night. &ldquo;I want to engage you as our counsel to help Helen find
      out about Jimmie's death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find out what?&rdquo; asked Kent, his bewilderment increasing. &ldquo;Do you mean
      that Jimmie's death was not the result of a dangerous heart disease, but
      of foul play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara nodded her head vigorously. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent sat back in his chair and regarded her in silence for a second. &ldquo;How
      could that be, Babs, in an open police court with dozens of spectators all
      about?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;The slightest attempt to kill him would have been
      frustrated by the police officials; remember, a prisoner especially, is
      hedged in and guarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he wasn't so very hedged in,&rdquo; retorted Barbara. &ldquo;I was there and
      saw how closely people approached Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you observe any one hand him anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; Barbara drawled the word as she strove to visualize the scene in
      the court room; then catching Kent's look of doubt she added with
      unmistakable emphasis. &ldquo;Helen and I do not believe that Jimmie died from
      natural causes; we think the tragedy should be investigated.&rdquo; Her soft
      voice deepened. &ldquo;I must know the truth, Harry, dear; for I feel that
      perhaps I am responsible for Jimmie's death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; Kent's voice rose in indignant protest. &ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't If it had not been for my wager with Jimmie, he never would
      have entered our house disguised as a burglar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What brought about the wager?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last Sunday Helen was boasting of her two new police dogs which Philip
      Rochester recently gave her, and said how safe she felt. We've had several
      burglaries in our neighborhood,&rdquo; Barbara explained, &ldquo;and when Jimmie
      scoffed at the dogs, I bet him that he could not break into the house
      without the dogs arousing the household. I never once thought about
      Jimmie's heart trouble,&rdquo; she confessed, and her lips quivered. &ldquo;I feel so
      guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are inconsistent, Babs,&rdquo; chided Kent gently. &ldquo;One moment you reproach
      yourself for being the cause of bringing on Jimmie's heart attack, and the
      next you declare you believe he died through foul play. You,&rdquo; looking at
      her tenderly, while a whimsical smile softened his stern mouth, &ldquo;don't go
      so far as to claim you murdered him, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I didn't!&rdquo; Barbara spoke with indignant emphasis, and her
      fingers snapped in uncontrollable nervousness. &ldquo;Jimmie was very dear&rdquo;&mdash;she
      hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;to us. Neither Helen nor I can leave a stone unturned
      until we know without a shadow of a doubt what killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is easily proven,&rdquo; declared Kent. &ldquo;An autopsy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen asked the coroner to hold one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared&mdash;the twins were certainly in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My advice to you is to wait until you hear the result of the post-mortem
      from Coroner Penfield,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;Until we know definitely what
      killed Jimmie, speculation is idle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara rose at once. &ldquo;I thought you would be more sympathetic,&rdquo; she
      remarked, and her voice was a bit unsteady. &ldquo;I am sorry to have troubled
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Kent was by her side. &ldquo;Barbara,&rdquo; he entreated. &ldquo;I promise
      solemnly to aid you in every possible way. My only happiness is in serving
      you,&rdquo; his voice was very tender. &ldquo;I slave here day in and day out that I
      may sometime be able to make a home for you. Don't leave me in anger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not angry, only deeply hurt,&rdquo; Barbara confessed. &ldquo;I have so longed
      to see you. I&mdash;I needed you! I&mdash;&rdquo; The rest was lost as she bowed
      her head against Kent's broad shoulder, and his impassioned whispers of
      devotion brought solace to her troubled spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; declared Barbara ten minutes later. &ldquo;Father would make a
      fearful scene if he knew I had been here to see you.&rdquo; She picked up her
      hand-bag, preparatory to leaving. &ldquo;Then I can tell Helen that you will aid
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kent stopped on his way to the door. &ldquo;I will try and see the
      coroner this afternoon. In the meantime, Babs, can't you tell me what
      makes you suspect that Jimmie might have been killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing tangible to go on,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Only a woman's instinct&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent did not smile. &ldquo;Instinct,&rdquo; he repeated thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well, does your
      instinct hazard a guess as to the weapon, the opportunity, and the motive
      for such a crime? Jimmie Turnbull hadn't an enemy in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara looked at him oddly. &ldquo;Suppose you find the answer to those
      conundrums,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Don't come to the elevator; Margaret Brewster
      may see you with me, and she would tell father of our meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mrs. Brewster still with you?&rdquo; asked Kent, paying no attention to her
      protests as he accompanied her down the corridor. &ldquo;I understood she
      planned to return to the West last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did, but father persuaded her to prolong her visit,&rdquo; Barbara was
      guilty of a grimace, then hailing the descending elevator she bolted into
      it and waved her good-by to Kent as the cage shot downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kent reentered his office he found Sylvester hanging up the telephone
      receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clymer has telephoned to ask if you will come to the Metropolis Trust
      Company at once,&rdquo; he said, and before Kent could frame a reply he had
      darted into the coat closet and brought out his hat and cane, and handed
      them to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't wait for me, but go out for your luncheon,&rdquo; directed Kent,
      observing the hour. &ldquo;I have my key and can get in when I return if you
      should not be here,&rdquo; and not waiting to hear Sylvester's thanks, he
      hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock over the bank had just struck noon when Kent reached the fine
      office building which housed the Metropolis Trust Company, and as he
      entered the bank, a messenger stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clymer is waiting for you in his private office, sir,&rdquo; he said, and
      led the way past the long rows of mahogany counters and plate glass
      windows to the back of the bank, finally stopping before a door bearing
      the name, in modest lettering&mdash;BENJAMIN AUGUSTUS CLYMER. The bank
      president was sensitive on one point; he never permitted initials only to
      be used before his name. The messenger's deferential knock was answered by
      a gruff command to enter. Clymer welcomed Kent with an air of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Colonel McIntyre,&rdquo; he said by way of introduction, and Kent
      became aware that the tall man lounging with his back to him in one of the
      leather covered chairs was Barbara's father. Colonel McIntyre returned
      Kent's bow with a curt nod, and then Clymer pushed forward a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Kent,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You have already handled several confidential
      affairs for the bank in a satisfactory manner, and I have sent for you
      to-day to ask your aid in an urgent matter. Before I go further I must ask
      you to treat what I am about to say as strictly confidential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Clymer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Then draw up your chair.&rdquo; Clymer waited until Kent had complied
      with his request. &ldquo;You have heard of Jimmie Turnbull's sudden and tragic
      death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you know, he was cashier of this bank.&rdquo; Clymer spoke with
      deliberation. &ldquo;Soon after word reached here of his death, the
      vice-president and treasurer of the bank had a careful examination made of
      his books and accounts.&rdquo; Clymer paused to clear his throat; he was
      troubled with an irritating cough. &ldquo;Turnbull's accounts were found in
      first class order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure they would be, Mr. Clymer,&rdquo; exclaimed Kent warmly. &ldquo;Any one who
      knew Jimmie would never doubt his honesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre turned in his chair and regarded the speaker with no friendly
      eye, but aside from that, took no part in the conversation. Clymer did not
      at once resume speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; he commenced finally, &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre called at the bank and
      asked the treasurer, Mr. Gilmore, for certain valuable negotiable
      securities which he left in the bank's care a month ago. Mr. Gilmore told
      Colonel McIntyre that these securities had been given to Jimmie Turnbull
      last Saturday on his presentation of a letter from McIntyre requesting
      that they be turned over to the bank's cashier. McIntyre expressed his
      surprise and asked to see the letter &ldquo;&mdash;Clymer paused and took a
      paper from his desk. &ldquo;Here is the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent took the paper and examined it closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is perfectly in order,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A clear statement in Colonel
      McIntyre's handwriting and on his stationery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Colonel McIntyre addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The letter is in order,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;and written on my stationery,
      but it was not written by me. The letter is a clever forgery.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. THE VANISHING MAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      It still lacked twenty minutes of nine o'clock that night when Harry Kent
      turned into the Saratoga apartment hotel, and not waiting to take one of
      the elevators, ran up the staircase to the apartment which had been
      occupied jointly by Jimmie Turnbull and Philip Rochester. Kent had already
      selected the right key from among those on the bunch he had found in
      Rochester's desk at the office, and slipping it into the key-hole of the
      outer door, he turned the lock and walked noiselessly inside the dark
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft click of the outer door as it swung to was hardly noticeable, and
      Kent, pausing only long enough to get his breath from his run up the
      staircase, stepped into the living room and reached for the electric light
      switch. Instead of encountering the cold metal of the switch his groping
      fingers closed over warm flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled as he was, Kent retained enough presence of mind to grasp the
      hand tightly; the next second a man hurled himself upon him and he gave
      back. Furniture in the path of the struggling men was overturned as they
      fought in silent desperation. Kent would have given much for light. He
      strained his eyes to see his adversary, but the pitch darkness concealed
      all but the vaguest outline. As Kent got his second wind, confidence in
      his strength returned and he redoubled his efforts; suddenly his hands
      shifted their grip and he swung his adversary backward, pinning him
      against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint, sobbing breath escaped the man, and Kent felt the whole figure
      against which he pressed, quiver and relax; the taut muscles of chest and
      arms grew slack, collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent stood in wonderment, peering ahead, his hands empty&mdash;the man had
      vanished!
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a long, long breath Kent felt his way back to the electric switch
      and pressed the button, lighting both the wall brackets and the table
      lamps. With both hands on his throbbing temples he gazed at the
      over-turned chairs; they, as well as his aching throat, testified to his
      encounter having been a reality and not a fantastic dream. His glance
      traveled this way and that about the room and rested longest on the
      opposite side of the room where he had pinned the man to the wall. Wall&mdash;!
      Kent leaned against a tall highboy and laughed weakly, immoderately. He
      had pushed the man straight against the door leading into Rochester's
      bedroom, and not, as he had supposed, against the solid wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had been quick-witted enough to grasp the situation; his pretended
      weakness had caused Kent to relax his hold, a turn of the knob of the
      door, which swung inward, and he had made his escape into the bedroom,
      leaving Kent staring into dark, empty space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gathering his wits together Kent hurried into the bedroom&mdash;it was
      empty; so also was the bathroom opening from it. From there Kent made the
      rounds of the apartment, switching on the light until the place was
      ablaze, but in spite of his minute search of closets and under beds and
      behind furniture he could find no trace of his late adversary. Kent
      stopped long enough in the pantry to refresh himself with a glass of
      water, then he returned to the living room and sat down in an arm chair by
      the window. He wanted time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      How had the man vanished so utterly, leaving no trace behind in the
      apartment? The window in Rochester's room was locked on the inside; in
      fact, all the apartment windows were securely fastened, he had found on
      his tour of inspection; the only one not locked was the oval, swinging
      window high up in the side wall of the bathroom; only a child could
      squeeze through it, Kent decided. The window looked into a well formed by
      the wings of the apartment house, and had a sheer drop of fifty feet to
      the ground below.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for his unfortunate luck in backing the man against the bedroom door
      instead of the wall he would not have escaped, but how had the man
      realized so instantly that he was against a door in the pitch darkness? It
      certainly showed familiarity with his surroundings. Kent sat upright as an
      idea flashed through his brain&mdash;was the man Philip Rochester?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent scouted the idea but it persisted. Suppose it had been Philip
      Rochester awakened from a drunken slumber by his entrance in the dark; if
      so, nothing more likely than that he had mistaken him, Kent, for a burglar
      and sprung at him. But why had he disappeared without revealing his
      identity to Kent? Surely the same reason worked both ways&mdash;the man
      who had wrestled with him was as unaware of Kent's identity as Kent was of
      his&mdash;they had fought in the dark and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent laughed aloud. The situation had its amusing side; then, as
      recollection came of the scene in the bank that morning, his mirth changed
      to grim seriousness. At his earnest solicitation and backed by Benjamin
      Clymer's endorsement of his plan, Colonel McIntyre had agreed to give him
      until Saturday night to locate the missing securities; if he failed, then
      the colonel proposed placing the affair in the hands of the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent's firm mouth settled into dogged lines at the thought; such a
      procedure meant besmirching Jimmie Turnbull's name; let the public get the
      slightest inkling that the bank cashier was suspected of forgery and there
      would be the devil to pay. Kent was determined to protect the honor of his
      dead friend, and to aid Helen McIntyre in her investigation of his sudden
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie Turnbull had been the soul of honor; that he had ever stooped to
      forgery was unbelievable. There was some explanation favorable to him&mdash;there
      must be. Kent's clenched fist struck the arm of his, chair a vigorous blow
      and he leapt to his feet. Wasting no further time on speculation, he
      commenced a systematic search of the apartment, replacing each chair and
      table as well as the rugs which had been over-turned in his recent tussle,
      after which he tried the drawers of Jimmie's desk. They were unlocked. A
      careful search brought nothing to light but receipted bills, some loose
      change, old dinner cards, theater programs, tea invitations, and several
      packages of cigarettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning from the desk Kent walked over to the table which he knew was
      Philip Rochester's property; he recalled having once seen Jimmie place
      some papers there by mistake; having done so once, the mistake might have
      occurred again. Taking out his partner's bunch of keys, he soon found one
      that fitted and opened the drawers. He had half completed his task,
      without finding any clew to the missing securities, when he was
      interrupted by the sound of the opening of the front door, and had but
      time to slam the drawers shut and pocket the keys when the night clerk of
      the hotel stepped inside the apartment and, closely followed by a
      sandy-haired man, walked into the living room. He halted abruptly at sight
      of Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and took in at a glance the
      orderly arrangement of the room. &ldquo;Pardon my unceremonious entrance, but I
      had no idea you were here, sir; we received a telephone message that a
      burglar had broken in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did!&rdquo; Kent stared at him. Was he right, after all, in his conjecture;
      had the man been Philip Rochester? It would seem so, for who else, after
      taking refuge elsewhere, would have telephoned a warning of burglars to
      the hotel office? &ldquo;Have you any idea who sent the message, Mr. Stuart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not; it was an out-side call&mdash;&rdquo; Stuart turned to his
      companion. &ldquo;Sorry I brought you here on an idiotic chase, Mr. Ferguson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; responded the detective good naturedly. &ldquo;Would you
      like me to look through the apartment just to see if any one really is
      concealed on the premises, Mr. Kent?&rdquo; he asked, and added quickly, seeing
      Kent hesitate, &ldquo;I am from the central office; Mr. Stuart can vouch for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent's hesitation vanished. &ldquo;I'd be obliged if you would, Ferguson.&rdquo; As he
      spoke he led the way to Rochester's bedroom. &ldquo;Come with us, Stuart,&rdquo; as
      the clerk loitered behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess not, sir; I'm needed down at the desk, we are short-handed
      to-night. Let me know how the hunt turns out,&rdquo; and he stepped into the
      vestibule. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; called Kent, and he accompanied Ferguson as far as the
      bathroom door, then returned to his inspection of Rochester's table. He
      had just completed his task when the detective rejoined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trace of any one,&rdquo; the latter announced. &ldquo;Some one put up a joke on
      Stuart, I imagine. Find what you wished, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent was distinctly annoyed by the question. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson ignored his curt tone. &ldquo;Will you spare me a few minutes of your
      time, Mr. Kent?&rdquo; he asked persuasively. &ldquo;I won't detain you long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; Kent moved over to the chair in the window which he had
      occupied before and pointed to another, equally as comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; he asked as Ferguson dropped back and stretched
      himself in the soft depths of the big chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supply some information,&rdquo; answered the detective promptly. &ldquo;Just a
      minute,&rdquo; as Kent started to interrupt. &ldquo;You don't recall me, but I met you
      while working on the Chase case; you handled that trial in great shape,&rdquo;
       Ferguson looked admiringly at his companion. &ldquo;Lots of the praise went to
      your partner, Mr. Rochester, but I know you did the work. Now, please let
      me finish,&rdquo; holding up a protesting hand. &ldquo;I know you've carried Mr.
      Rochester in your firm; he's dead wood.&rdquo; Kent was silent. What the
      detective said was only too true. Rochester, realizing the talent and
      industry which characterized his younger partner, had withdrawn more and
      more from active practice, and had devoted himself to the social life of
      the National Capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is rather a long-winded way of reaching my point,&rdquo; finished the
      detective. &ldquo;But, Mr. Kent, I want your assistance in a puzzling case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, I'm listening.&rdquo; As he spoke, Kent drew out his cigar case and
      handed it to Ferguson. &ldquo;The matches are on the smoking stand at your
      elbow. Now, what is it, Ferguson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion did not reply at once; instead he puffed at his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you read in the paper about Mr. Turnbull's death?&rdquo; he asked when the
      cigar was drawing to his satisfaction, and as Kent nodded a silent
      affirmative in answer to his question, he asked another. &ldquo;Did you know him
      well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he have an enemy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo; Kent was watching the detective narrowly; what was
      he driving at? &ldquo;On the contrary Turnbull was extremely popular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Colonel McIntyre?&rdquo; Ferguson had hoped to surprise Kent with the
      question, but his companion's expression did not alter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no, perhaps he was not over-popular with the colonel,&rdquo; he admitted
      slowly. &ldquo;What prompts the question, Ferguson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective hitched his chair nearer. &ldquo;I'm going to lay all my cards on
      the table,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I need advice and you are the man to give it to
      me. Listen, Mr. Kent, this Jimmie Turnbull masquerades as a burglar night
      before last at the McIntyre house, is arrested, a charge brought against
      him for house-breaking by Miss Helen McIntyre, and shortly after he dies&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From angina pectoris,&rdquo; finished Kent, as the detective paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Rochester contended,&rdquo; admitted Ferguson. &ldquo;We'll let that go for a
      minute. Now, when Miss McIntyre saw Turnbull's body, she demanded an
      autopsy. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To discover the cause of death,&rdquo; answered Kent quietly. &ldquo;That is obvious,
      Ferguson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. And why did she wish to discover it?&rdquo; He waited a brief instant,
      then answered his own question. &ldquo;Because Miss McIntyre did not agree with
      Rochester that Turnbull had died from angina pectoris&mdash;that is
      obvious, too. Now, what made her think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I don't know&rdquo;&mdash;Kent's air of candor was unmistakable and
      Ferguson showed his disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't Miss McIntyre been to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; was Kent's truthful answer; Barbara was the younger twin and her
      sister was therefore, &ldquo;Miss McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must recollect, Ferguson,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that had Miss McIntyre called
      to see me about poor Turnbull, I would not have discussed the interview
      with any one, under any conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I am not asking you to break any confidences; in fact,&rdquo;
       Ferguson smiled, &ldquo;I must ask you to consider our conversation
      confidential. Now, Mr. Kent, does it not strike you as odd that apparently
      the only man in Washington who really disliked Turnbull was Colonel
      McIntyre, and it is his daughter who intimates that Turnbull's death was
      not due to natural causes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; Kent shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You are taking an exaggerated
      view of the affair. Colonel McIntyre is an honorable upright American, and
      Turnbull was the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People speak highly of both men,&rdquo; acknowledged the detective. &ldquo;I saw Mr.
      Clymer, president of Turnbull's bank this afternoon, and he paid a fine
      tribute to his dead cashier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent drew an inward sigh of relief. Benjamin Clymer had proved true blue;
      he had not permitted Colonel McIntyre's desire for immediate publicity and
      belief in Turnbull's guilt to shake his faith in his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Ferguson, there is no motive for such a crime as you suggest,&rdquo;
       he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for the motive,&rdquo;&mdash;Ferguson rubbed his hands nervously together
      as he shot a look at his questioner; the latter's clear-cut features and
      manly bearing inspired confidence. &ldquo;We know of no motive,&rdquo; he corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we know of no crime having been perpetrated,&rdquo; rapped out Kent. &ldquo;Come,
      man; don't hunt a mare's nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but it isn't a mare's nest!&rdquo; Ferguson remarked dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent bent eagerly forward&mdash;&ldquo;You have heard from the coroner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Ferguson jerked forward his chair until his knees touched Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had either man looked toward the window near which they were sitting, he
      would have seen a black shadow squatting ape-like on the window ledge. As
      Kent leaned over to relight his cigar, the face at the window vanished, to
      cautiously reappear a second later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The case piqued my interest,&rdquo; continued the detective after a pause. &ldquo;And
      I made an investigation on my own hook. After the departure of the
      McIntyre twins and Coroner Penfield, I went back to the court room and
      poked around the prisoners' cage. There I found this.&rdquo; He took out of his
      pocket a small bundle and carefully unwrapped the oil-skin cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A handkerchief?&rdquo; questioned Kent as the detective did not unfold the
      white muslin, but held it with care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. One of the prisoners in the cage told me Turnbull dropped it as Dr.
      Stone and the deputy marshal carried him into the ante-room. Smell
      anything?&rdquo; holding up the handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kent wrinkled his nose and sniffed several times. &ldquo;Smells like
      fruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson nodded. &ldquo;Good guess; I noticed the odor and went at once to Dr.
      McLane. He told me the handkerchief was saturated with amyl nitrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amyl nitrite,&rdquo; repeated Kent reflectively. &ldquo;It is given for angina
      pectoris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well, in this case it was the remedy and not the disease which
      killed Turnbull,&rdquo; announced Ferguson triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; ejaculated Kent. &ldquo;I happen to know that the capsules contain
      only three minims&mdash;I once heard Turnbull say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, but Turnbull got a lethal dose, all right; and he thought he was
      taking only the regular one. Devilishly ingenious on the part of the
      criminal, wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Have you detected the criminal?&rdquo; Kent put the question with unmoved
      countenance, but with inward foreboding; the detective's mysterious manner
      was puzzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, but I will,&rdquo; Ferguson hesitated. &ldquo;The first thing was to
      establish that a crime had really been committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent bent down and sniffed again at the handkerchief to which a faint
      fruity aroma still clung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you discover that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. McLane and I took the handkerchief to a laboratory and the chemist
      found from the number of particles of capsules in the handkerchief, that
      at least two capsules&mdash;or double the usual dose&mdash;had been
      crushed by Turnbull and the fumes inhaled by him; with fatal results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; cautioned Kent. &ldquo;In the flurry of the moment, Turnbull may have
      accidentally put two capsules in the handkerchief, meaning only to use
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kent,&rdquo; the detective spoke impressively, &ldquo;that wasn't Turnbull's
      handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not his own handkerchief!&rdquo; exclaimed Kent. &ldquo;Then, are you sure that
      Turnbull used it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that fact is established by reputable witnesses; Dr. Stone, Mr.
      Clymer, and the deputy marshal,&rdquo; Ferguson spoke with increasing
      earnestness. &ldquo;That is a woman's handkerchief&mdash;look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson laid the little bundle on the broad arm of Kent's chair and with
      infinite care folded back the edges of the handkerchief, revealing as he
      did so, the small particles of capsules still clinging to the linen. But
      Kent hardly observed the capsules, his entire attention being centered on
      one corner of the handkerchief, which had neatly embroidered on it the
      letter &ldquo;B.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI. STRAIGHT QUESTIONS AND CROOKED ANSWERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre, with an angry gesture, threw down the newspaper he had
      been reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, Helen, that you decline to go to the supper to-night
      on account of the death of Jimmie 'Turnbull?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre flushed a dark red; he was not accustomed to scenes with either
      of his daughters, and here was Helen flouting his authority and Barbara
      backing her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite time this pretense is dropped,&rdquo; he remarked stiffly. &ldquo;You
      were not engaged to Jimmie&mdash;wait,&rdquo; as she attempted to interrupt him.
      &ldquo;You told me the night of the burglary that he was nothing to you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was mistaken,&rdquo; Helen's voice shook, she was very near to tears. &ldquo;When I
      saw Jimmie lying there, dead&rdquo;&mdash;she faltered, and her shoulders
      drooped forlornly&mdash;&ldquo;the world stopped for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hysterical nonsense!&rdquo; McIntyre was careful to avoid Barbara's eyes; her
      indignant snort had been indicative of her feelings. &ldquo;Keep to your room,
      Helen, until you regain some common sense. It is as well our friends
      should not see you in your present frame of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen regarded her father under lowered lids. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said
      submissively and walked toward the door; on reaching it she paused, and
      spoke over her shoulder. &ldquo;Don't try me too far, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre stared for a full minute at the doorway through which Helen took
      her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what the&mdash;&rdquo; He pulled himself up short in the middle of the
      ejaculation and turned to Barbara. &ldquo;Go and get dressed,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;We
      must leave here in twenty minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not going!&rdquo; McIntyre frowned, then laughed abruptly. &ldquo;Now, don't tell me
      you were engaged to Jimmie Turnbull, also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are horrid!&rdquo; Barbara's small foot came down with a vigorous
      stamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps I am,&rdquo; her father admitted rather wearily. &ldquo;Don't keep us
      waiting, Babs; the car will be here in less than twenty minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, I prefer to stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I prefer to have you accompany us,&rdquo; retorted McIntyre. &ldquo;Come,
      Barbara, we cannot be discourteous to Mrs. Brewster; she is our guest, and
      this supper is for her entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take her.&rdquo; Barbara was openly rebellious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbara!&rdquo; His tone caused her to look at him in wonder; instead of the
      stern rebuke she expected, his voice was almost wheedling. &ldquo;I cannot very
      well take Mrs. Brewster to a cafe at this hour without causing gossip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fiddle-sticks!&rdquo; exclaimed Barbara. &ldquo;I don't have to play chaperon for
      you two. Every one knows she is visiting us; what's there improper in your
      taking her out to supper? Why&rdquo;&mdash;regarding him critically&mdash;&ldquo;she's
      young enough to be your daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to your room!&rdquo; There was nothing wheedling about McIntyre at that
      instant; he was thoroughly incensed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Barbara sped out happy in having gained her way, she announced, as a
      parting shot, &ldquo;If you can be nasty to Helen; father, I can be nasty, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre brought his fist down on a smoking table with such force
      that he scattered its contents over the floor. When he rose from picking
      up the debris, he found Mrs. Brewster at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks, everything is back in place.&rdquo; He pulled forward a chair for
      her. &ldquo;If agreeable to you I will telephone Ben Clymer that we will stop
      for him and take him with us to the Cafe St. Marks; or would you prefer
      some other man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; She threw her evening wrap across the sofa and sat down. &ldquo;Are
      the girls ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&mdash;they are indisposed, and won't be able to go to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Both girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, both&rdquo;&mdash;firmly, not, however, meeting her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't I better stay with them?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Have you telephoned or Dr.
      Stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no necessity for giving up our little spree,&rdquo; he declared
      cheerily. &ldquo;The girls don't need a physician. They&rdquo;&mdash;with meaning,
      &ldquo;need a mother's care.&rdquo; He picked up her coronation scarf from the floor
      where it had slipped and laid it across her bare shoulders; the action was
      almost a caress. She made a lovely picture as she sat in the high-backed
      carved chair in her chic evening gown, and as her soft dark eyes met his
      ardent look, McIntyre felt the hot blood surge to his temples, and with
      quickened pulse he went to the telephone stand and gave Central a number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in her chair Mrs. Brewster sat thoughtfully watching him. She had
      been an unobserved witness of the scene with Barbara, having entered the
      library in time to hear the girl's last remarks. It was not the first
      inkling that she had had of their disapproval of Colonel McIntyre's
      attentions to her, but it had hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow had become acquainted with the twins when, traveling in Europe
      just before the outbreak of the World War, and had made the hasty trip
      back to this country in their company. Colonel McIntyre had planned to
      bring the twins, then at school in Paris, home himself, but business had
      kept him in the West and he had cabled to a spinster cousin to chaperon
      them on the trip across the Atlantic Ocean. Nor had he reached New York in
      time to see them disembark, and thus had missed meeting Mrs. Brewster,
      then in her first year of widowhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendship between the twins and Mrs. Brewster had been kept up
      through much correspondence, and the widow had finally promised, to come
      to Washington for their debut, visiting her cousins, Dr. and Mrs. Stone.
      The meeting had but cemented the friendship between them, and at the
      twins' urgent request, seconded with warmth by Colonel McIntyre, she had
      promised to spend the month of April at the McIntyre home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit was nearly over. Mrs. Brewster sighed faintly. There were two
      courses open to her, immediate departure, or to continue to ignore the
      twins' strangely antagonistic behavior&mdash;the first course did not suit
      Mrs. Brewster's plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, who had left the library through one of its seven doors, had
      failed to see Mrs. Brewster by the slightest margin; she was intent only
      on being with Helen. The affection between the twins was very close; but
      while their facial resemblance was remarkable, their natures were totally
      dissimilar. Helen, the elder by twenty minutes, was studious, shy, and too
      much given to introspection; Barbara, on the contrary, was whimsical and
      practical by turns, with a great capacity for enjoyment. The twins had
      made their debut jointly on their eighteenth birthday, and while both were
      popular, Barbara had received the greater amount of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara tip-toed into the suite of rooms which the girls occupied over the
      library, expecting to find Helen lying on the lounge; instead, she found
      her writing busily at her desk. She tossed down her pen as her sister
      entered, and, taking up a blotter, carefully laid it across the page she
      had been writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank heaven, I don't have to go to that supper party,&rdquo; Barbara
      announced, throwing herself full length on the lounge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So father gave it up,&rdquo; commented Helen. &ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gave up nothing,&rdquo; retorted her sister. &ldquo;He and Margaret Brewster are
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Helen was on her feet. &ldquo;You let them go out alone together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't be alone if they are together,&rdquo; answered Barbara practically.
      &ldquo;Don't be silly, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen did not answer at once; she had grown singularly pale. Walking over
      to the window she glanced into the street. &ldquo;The car hasn't come,&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, and consulted her wrist watch. &ldquo;Hurry, Babs, you have just,
      time to dress and go with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-b-but I said I wouldn't go,&rdquo; stuttered Barbara, completely taken by
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter; tell father you have changed your mind.&rdquo; Helen held out her
      hand. &ldquo;Come, to please me,&rdquo; and there was a world of wistful appeal in her
      hazel eyes which Barbara was unable to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until Barbara had completed her hasty toilet and a frantic dash
      downstairs in time to spring into the waiting limousine after Margaret
      Brewster, that she realized she had put on one of Helen's evening gowns
      and not her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin Clymer was standing in the vestibule of the Saratoga, where he
      made his home, when the McIntyre limousine drew up, and he did not keep
      them waiting, as Colonel McIntyre had predicted he would on the drive to
      Clymer's apartment house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clerk gave me your message when I came in, McIntyre,&rdquo; he explained as
      the car drove off. &ldquo;I called up your residence and Grimes said you were on
      the way here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara, tucked away in her corner of the limousine, listened to Mrs.
      Brewster's animated chatter with utter lack of interest; she wished most
      heartily that she had not been over-persuaded by her sister, and had
      remained at home. That her father had accepted her lame explanation and
      her presence in the party with unaffected pleasure had been plain. Mrs.
      Brewster, after a quiet inquiry regarding her health, had been less
      enthusiastic in her welcome. Barbara was just stifling a yawn when the
      limousine stopped at the entrance to the Cafe St. Marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the cafe all was light and gaiety, and Barbara brightened
      perceptibly as the attentive head waiter ushered them to the table Colonel
      McIntyre had reserved earlier in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a novel idea turning the old church into a cafe,&rdquo; Barbara remarked
      to Benjamin Clymer. &ldquo;A sort of casting bread upon the waters of famished
      Washington. I wonder if they ever turn water into wine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such luck,&rdquo; groaned Clymer dismally, looking with distaste at the
      sparkling grape juice being poured into the erstwhile champagne goblet by
      his plate. &ldquo;The cafe is crowded to-night,&rdquo; and he gazed with interest
      about the room. Colonel McIntyre, who had loitered behind to speak to
      several friends at an adjacent table, took the unoccupied seat by Mrs.
      Brewster and was soon in animated conversation with the widow and Clymer;
      Barbara, her healthy appetite asserting itself, devoted her entire
      attention to the delicious delicacies placed before her. The arrival of
      the after-the-theater crowd awoke her from her abstraction, and she
      accepted Clymer's invitation to dance with alacrity. When they returned to
      the table she discovered that Margaret Brewster and her father had also
      joined the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara watched them while keeping up a disjointed conversation with
      Clymer, whose absentminded remarks finally drew Barbara's attention, and
      she wondered what had come over the generally entertaining banker. It was
      on the tip of her tongue to ask him the reason for his distrait manner
      when her thoughts were diverted by his next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father and Mrs. Brewster make a fine couple,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Colonel
      McIntyre is the most distinguished looking man in the cafe and Mrs.
      Brewster is a regular beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of replying Barbara turned in her seat and scanned her father as
      he and Mrs. Brewster passed them in the dance. Colonel McIntyre did not
      look his age of forty-seven years. His hair, prematurely gray, had a most
      attractive wave to it, and his erect and finely proportioned figure showed
      to advantage in his well-cut dress suit. Barbara's heart swelled with
      pride&mdash;her dear and handsome father! Then she transferred her regard
      to Margaret Brewster; she had been such a satisfactory friend&mdash;why
      oh, why did she wish to become her step-mother? The twins, with the
      unerring instinct of womanhood, had decided ten days before that Weller's
      warning to his son was timely&mdash;Mrs. Brewster was a most dangerous
      widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is your sister?&rdquo; inquired Clymer, breaking the silence which had
      lasted nearly five minutes. He was never quite certain which twin he was
      talking to, and generally solved the problem by familiarizing himself with
      their mode of dress. The plan had not always worked as the twins had a
      bewildering habit of exchanging clothes, to the enjoyment of Barbara's
      mischief loving soul, and the mystification of their numerous admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rather blue and depressed,&rdquo; answered Barbara. &ldquo;We are both feeling
      the reaction from the shock of Jimmie Turnbull's tragic death. You must
      forgive me if I am a bore; I am not good company to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of the head waiter at their table interrupted Clymer's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gentleman desires to speak to you a moment, Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; he said,
      and indicated a young man in a sack suit standing just back of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Parker of the Post,&rdquo; the reporter introduced himself with a bow which
      included Clymer. &ldquo;May I sit down?&rdquo; laying his hand on the back of Mrs.
      Brewster's vacant chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely; and won't you have an ice?&rdquo; Barbara's hospitable instincts were
      aroused. &ldquo;Here, waiter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks; I haven't time,&rdquo; protested Parker, slipping into the chair.
      &ldquo;I just came from your house, Miss McIntyre; the butler said I might find
      you here, and as it was rather important, I took the liberty of
      introducing myself. We plan to run a story, featuring the dangers of
      masquerading in society, and of course it hinges on the death of Mr.
      Turnbull. I'm sorry&rdquo;&mdash;he apologized as he saw Barbara wince. &ldquo;I
      realize the topic is one to make you feel badly; but I promise to ask only
      few questions.&rdquo; His smile was very engaging and Barbara's resentment
      receded somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you recognize Mr. Turnbull in his burglar's make-up when you
      confronted him in the police court?&rdquo; Parker drew out copy paper and a
      pencil, and waited for her reply. There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not recognize Mr. Turnbull in court,&rdquo; she stated finally. &ldquo;His
      death was a frightful shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. It was to everybody,&rdquo; agreed Parker. &ldquo;How about your sister, Miss
      Barbara; did she recognize him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parker showed his disappointment; he was not eliciting much information.
      Abruptly he turned to Clymer, whose prominent position in the financial
      world made him a familiar figure to all Washingtonians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren't you present in the police court on Tuesday morning also?&rdquo; Parker
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Clymer modified the curt monosyllable by adding, &ldquo;I helped Dr.
      Stone carry Turnbull out of the prisoners' cage and into the anteroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you recognize your cashier?&rdquo; demanded Parker. At the question
      Barbara set down her goblet of water without care for its perishable
      quality and looked with quick intentness at the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognized Mr. Turnbull when his wig was removed,&rdquo; answered Clymer,
      raising his head in time to catch Barbara's eyes gazing steadfastly at
      him. With a faint flush she turned her attention to the reporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull's make-up must have been superfine,&rdquo; Parker remarked. &ldquo;Just
      one more question. Can you tell me if Mr. Philip Rochester recognized his
      room-mate when he was defending him in court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I cannot,&rdquo; and observing Parker's blank expression, she added, &ldquo;why
      don't you ask Mr. Rochester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I can't locate him; he seems to have vanished off the face of the
      globe.&rdquo; The reporter rose. &ldquo;You can't tell me where's he's gone, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the faintest idea,&rdquo; answered Barbara truthfully. &ldquo;I was at his
      office this&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped abruptly on finding that Mrs. Brewster was
      standing just behind her. Had the widow by chance overheard her remark? If
      so, her father would probably learn of her visit to the office of
      Rochester and Kent that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand that Philip Rochester is out of town?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
      Brewster. &ldquo;Why, I had an appointment with him to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone and left no address that I can find,&rdquo; explained Parker. &ldquo;Thank
      you, Miss McIntyre; good evening,&rdquo; and the busy reporter hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious expression in Mrs. Brewster's eyes, but she dropped
      her gaze on her finger bowl too quickly for Clymer to analyze its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can have taken Mr. Rochester out of town?&rdquo; she asked. The question
      was not addressed to any one in particular, but Colonel McIntyre answered
      it, as he did most of the widow's remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry Washington,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It isn't the first trip Philip has made
      to Baltimore since the 'dry' law has been in force, eh, Clymer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, and it won't be his last,&rdquo; was the banker's response. &ldquo;What's the
      matter, Miss McIntyre?&rdquo; as Barbara pushed back her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel a little faint,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;The air here is&mdash;is
      stifling. If you don't mind, father, I'll take the car and drive home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come with you,&rdquo; announced Mrs. Brewster, rising hurriedly; and as
      she turned solicitously to aid Barbara she caught Colonel McIntyre's
      admiring glance and his whispered thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the cafe Clymer discovered that the McIntyre limousine was not to
      be found, and, cautioning Barbara and the widow to remain where they were,
      he went back into the cafe in search of Colonel McIntyre, who had stayed
      behind to pay his bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden exodus from the cafe as other diners came out to get their cars,
      separated Barbara from Mrs. Brewster just as the former caught sight of
      her father's limousine coming around McPherson Square. Not waiting to see
      what had become of her companion, Barbara started up the sidewalk intent
      on catching their chauffeur's attention. As she stood by the curb, a
      figure brushed by her and a paper was deftly slipped inside her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara wheeled about abruptly. She stood alone, except for several
      elaborately dressed women and their companions some yards away who were
      indulging in noisy talk as they hurried along. At that moment the McIntyre
      limousine stopped at the curb and the chauffeur opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me home, Harris,&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;And then come back for Mrs. Brewster
      and father. I don't feel well&mdash;hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, miss,&rdquo; and touching his cap the chauffeur swung his car up
      Fifteenth Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The limousine had turned into Massachusetts Avenue before Barbara switched
      on the electric lamp in the car and opened the note so mysteriously given
      to her. She read feverishly the few lines it contained,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Dear Helen:
  The coroner will call an inquest. Secrete letter &ldquo;B.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The note was unsigned but it was in the handwriting of Philip Rochester.

      CHAPTER VII. THE RED SEAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The gloomy morning, with leaden skies and intermittent rain, reflected
      Harry Kent's state of mind. He could not fix his attention on the business
      letters which Sylvester placed before him; instead, his thoughts reverted
      to the scene in Rochester's and Turnbull's apartment the night before, the
      elusive visitor he had found there on his arrival, his interview with
      Detective Ferguson, and above all the handkerchief, saturated with amyl
      nitrite, and bearing the small embroidered letter &ldquo;B&rdquo;&mdash;the initial,
      insignificant in size, but fraught with dire possibilities if, as Ferguson
      hinted, Turnbull had been put to death by an over-dose of the drug. &ldquo;B &ldquo;&mdash;Barbara;
      Barbara&mdash;&ldquo;B&rdquo;&mdash;his mind rang the changes; pshaw! other names than
      Barbara began with &ldquo;B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I transcribe your notes, Mr. Kent?&rdquo; asked Sylvester, and Kent
      awakened from his reverie, discovered that he had scrawled the name
      Barbara and capital &ldquo;Bs&rdquo; on the writing pad. He tore off the sheet and
      crumpled it into a small ball. &ldquo;No, my notes are unimportant.&rdquo; Kent
      unlocked his desk and took some manuscript from one of the drawers. &ldquo;Make
      four copies of this brief, then call up the printer and ask how soon he
      will complete the work on hand. Has Mr. Clymer telephoned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this morning.&rdquo; Sylvester rose, papers in hand. &ldquo;There has been a Mr.
      Parker of the Post who telephones regularly once an hour to ask for Mr.
      Rochester's address and when he is expected at the office.&rdquo; He paused and
      looked inquiringly at Kent. &ldquo;What shall I say the next time he calls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Switch him on my phone,&rdquo; briefly. &ldquo;That is all now, Sylvester. I must be
      in court by noon, so have the brief copied by eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and Sylvester departed, only to return a second later. &ldquo;Miss
      McIntyre to see you,&rdquo; he announced, and stood aside to allow the girl to
      enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time Kent had seen Helen since the tragedy of Tuesday,
      and as he advanced to greet her he noted with concern her air of distress
      and the troubled look in her eyes. Her composed manner was obviously only
      maintained by the exertion of self-control, for the hand she offered him
      was unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so kind,&rdquo; she murmured as he placed a chair for her. &ldquo;Babs told
      me you have promised your aid, and so I have come&mdash;&rdquo; she pressed one
      hand to her side as if she found breathing difficult and Kent, reaching
      for his pitcher of ice water which stood near at hand, filled a tumbler
      and gave it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a little,&rdquo; he coaxed as she moved as if to refuse the glass. &ldquo;Why
      didn't you telephone and I would have called on you; in fact, I planned to
      run in and see you this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wiser to have our talk here,&rdquo; she replied. Setting down the empty
      glass she gazed about the office and her face brightened at sight of a
      safe standing in one corner. &ldquo;Is that yours or Philip's?&rdquo; she asked,
      pointing to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The safe? Oh, it's for our joint use, owned by the firm, you know,&rdquo;
       explained Kent, somewhat puzzled by her eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you keep your private papers there, as well as the firm's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; Philip has retained one section and I the other.&rdquo; Kent walked
      over and threw open the massive door which he had unlocked on entering the
      office and left ajar. &ldquo;Would you like to see the arrangements of the
      compartments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without answering Helen crossed the room and stood by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is Philip's section?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; and Kent touched the side of the safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen turned around and inspected the office; the outer door through which
      she had entered was closed, as were also the private door leading directly
      into the outside corridor, and the one opening into the closet. Convinced
      that they were really alone, she took from her leather hand-bag a white
      envelope and handed it to Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please put this in Philip's compartment,&rdquo; she said, and as he hesitated,
      she added pleadingly, &ldquo;Please do it, Harry, and ask no questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked at her wonderingly; the girl was obviously laboring under
      intense excitement of some sort, which might at any moment break into
      hysteria. Bottling up his curiosity, he stooped down in front of the safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I will put the envelope away for you,&rdquo; he agreed cheerily.
      &ldquo;Wait, though, I must find if Philip left the key of the compartment on
      his bunch.&rdquo; He took from his pocket the keys he had found so useful the
      night before, and selected one that resembled the key to his own
      compartment, and inserted it in the lock. To his surprise he discovered
      the compartment was already unlocked. Without comment he pulled open the
      inside drawer and started to lay the white envelope on top of the papers
      already there, when he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The envelope is unaddressed, Helen,&rdquo; he remarked, extending it toward
      her. She waved it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sealed with red wax,&rdquo; she stated. &ldquo;That is all that is necessary
      for identification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned over the envelope&mdash;the flap was held down securely with a
      large red seal which bore the one letter &ldquo;B.&rdquo; He dropped the envelope
      inside the drawer, locked the compartment, and closed the door of the
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk,&rdquo; he suggested and led the way back to their chairs. &ldquo;Helen,&rdquo;
       he began, after she was seated. &ldquo;There is nothing I will not do for your
      sister Barbara,&rdquo; his manner grew earnest. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; he flushed; baring
      his feelings to another, no matter how sympathetic that other was, was
      foreign to his reserved nature. &ldquo;I love her beyond words to express. I
      tell you this to&mdash;to&mdash;gain your trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You already have it, Harry!&rdquo; Impulsively Helen extended her hand, and he
      held it in a firm clasp for a second. &ldquo;Babs and I have come at once to you
      in our trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you have only hinted what that trouble, was,&rdquo; he reminded her
      gently. &ldquo;I cannot really aid you until you give me your full confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen looked away from him and out of the window. The relief, which had
      lighted her face a moment before, had vanished. It was some minutes before
      she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babs told you that I suspected Jimmie did not die from angina pectoris&mdash;&rdquo;
       She spoke with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a second before continuing her remarks. &ldquo;I have asked the
      coroner to make an investigation.&rdquo; She paused again, then added with more
      animation, &ldquo;He is the one to tell us if a crime has been committed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can tell if death has been accelerated by a weapon, or a drug,&rdquo;
       responded Kent; he was weighing his words carefully so that she might
      understand him fully. &ldquo;But to constitute a crime, it has to be proved
      first, that the act has been committed, and second, that a guilty mind or
      malice prompted it. Can you furnish a clew to establish either of the last
      mentioned facts in connection with Jimmie's death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent wondered if she had heard him, she was so long in replying, and he
      was about to repeat his question when she addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard from Coroner Penfield?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I tried several times to get him on the telephone, but without
      success,&rdquo; replied Kent; his disappointment at not receiving an answer to
      his question showed in his manner. &ldquo;I went to Penfield's house last night,
      but he had been called away on a case and, although I waited until nearly
      ten o'clock, he had not returned when I left. Have you had word from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;not directly.&rdquo; She had been nervously twisting her handkerchief
      about in her fingers; suddenly she turned and looked full at Kent, her
      eyes burning feverishly. &ldquo;I would give all I possess, my hope of future
      happiness even, if I could prove that Jimmie died from angina pectoris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked at her in mingled sympathy and doubt.&mdash;What did her words
      imply&mdash;further tragedy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie might not have died from angina pectoris,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and still not
      have been poisoned&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Helen took in his meaning, but she volunteered no remark, and Kent
      after a pause, added, &ldquo;While I have not seen Coroner Penfield I did hear
      last night what killed Jimmie.&rdquo; Helen straightened up, one hand pressed to
      her heart. &ldquo;It was a lethal dose of amyl nitrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amyl nitrite,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Yes, I have heard that it is given for
      heart trouble. How&rdquo;&mdash;she looked at him queerly. &ldquo;How is it
      administered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By crushing a capsule in a handkerchief and inhaling its fumes &ldquo;&mdash;he
      was watching her closely. &ldquo;The handkerchief Jimmie was seen to use just
      before he died was found to contain two or more broken capsules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen sat immovable for over a minute, then she bowed her head and burst
      into dry tearless sobs which wracked her body. Kent laid a tender hand on
      her shoulder, then concluding it was better for her to have her cry out,
      he wandered aimlessly about the office waiting for her to regain her
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped before one of the windows facing south and stared moodily at
      the Belasco Theater. That playhouse had surely never staged a more
      complicated mystery than the one he had set himself to unravel. What
      consolation could he offer Helen? If he encouraged her belief in his
      theory that Jimmie committed suicide he would have to establish a motive
      for suicide, and that motive might prove to be the theft of Colonel
      McIntyre's valuable securities. Threatened with exposure as a thief and
      forger, Jimmie had committed suicide, so would run the verdict; the fact
      of his suicide was proof of his guilt of the crime Colonel McIntyre
      virtually charged him with, and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had been discovered to point to murder? The finding of a
      handkerchief, saturated with amyl nitrite, which had not belonged to the
      dead man. Proof&mdash;bah! it was ridiculous! What more likely than that
      Jimmie, while in the McIntyre house before his arrest as a burglar, had
      picked up one of Barbara's handkerchiefs, stuffed it inside his pocket,
      and when threatened with exposure on being held for the grand jury, had,
      in desperation, crushed the amyl nitrite capsules in Barbara's
      handkerchief and killed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent drew a long, long sigh. His faith in Jimmie's honesty was shaken at
      last by the accumulative evidence, and he was convinced that he had found
      the solution to the problem, but how impart it to the weeping girl? To
      prove her lover a thief, forger, and suicide was indeed a task he shrank
      from.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring at the telephone caused Kent to move hastily to the instrument;
      when he hung up the receiver Helen was adjusting her veil before a mirror
      over the mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre is in the next room,&rdquo; he said, keeping his voice
      lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; Helen's eyes were hard and dry. &ldquo;Does he know that I am
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; Sylvester simply said he had called to see me and is
      waiting in the outer office.&rdquo; Observing her indecision, Kent opened the
      door leading directly into the corridor. &ldquo;You can leave this way without
      encountering Colonel McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen hurried through the door and paused in the corridor to whisper
      feverishly in Kent's ear, &ldquo;Promise me you will remain faithful to Barbara
      whatever develops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; Kent's pledge rang out clearly, and Helen with a lighter heart
      turned to walk away when a telegraph boy appeared around the corner of the
      corridor and thrust a yellow envelope at Kent, who stood half inside his
      office watching Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign here,&rdquo; the boy said, indicating the line on the receipt slip, and
      getting it back, departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motioning to Helen to wait, Kent tore open the telegram. It was from
      Cleveland and dated the night before. The message ran: Called to
      Cleveland. Address City Club. Rochester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without comment Kent held out the telegram so that Helen could read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Philip in Cleveland last night. I&mdash;I&mdash;don't
      understand.&rdquo; And looking at her Kent was astounded at the flash of terror
      which shone for an instant in her eyes. Before he had time to question her
      she bolted around the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent remained staring ahead for an instant then returned thoughtfully to
      his office, and within a second Sylvester received a telephone message to
      show Colonel McIntyre into Kent's office. Not only Colonel McIntyre
      followed the clerk into the room but Benjamin Clymer. &ldquo;Any further
      developments, Kent?&rdquo; inquired the banker. &ldquo;No, we can't sit down; just
      dropped in to see you a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing new,&rdquo; Kent had made instant decision; such information
      regarding the death of Turnbull as he had gleaned from Ferguson, and the
      events of the night before should be confided to Clymer alone, and not in
      the presence of Colonel McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you search Turnbull's apartment last night as you spoke of doing?&rdquo;
       asked McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, and found no trace of your securities, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre lifted his eyebrows as he smiled sarcastically. &ldquo;Can I see
      Rochester?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in Cleveland; I don't know just when he will be back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? Too bad you haven't the benefit of his advice,&rdquo; remarked McIntyre
      insolently. &ldquo;At Clymer's request, Kent, I have allowed you until Saturday
      night to find the securities and either clear Turnbull's name or admit his
      guilt; there remain two days and a half before I take the affair in my own
      hands and make it public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to establish Turnbull's innocence before that time,&rdquo; retorted Kent
      coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly his spirits sank; had not every effort on his part brought but
      further proof of Jimmie's guilt? That McIntyre would make no attempt to
      hush up the scandal was obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep me informed of your progress,&rdquo; McIntyre's manner was domineering and
      Kent felt the blood mount to his temples, but he was determined not to
      lose his temper whatever the provocation; McIntyre was Barbara's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clymer, aware that the atmosphere was getting strained, diplomatically
      intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dine with me to-night, Kent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps you will then have some
      news that will throw light on the present whereabouts of the securities. I
      found, on making inquiries, that they have not been offered for sale in
      the usual channels. Come, McIntyre, I have a directors' meeting in twenty
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre, who had been swinging his walking stick from one hand to the
      other in marked impatience, turned to Kent, his manner more conciliatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant quarters you have,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Does Rochester share his room
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Colonel, his is across the ante-room where you waited a few minutes
      ago,&rdquo; explained Kent as he accompanied his visitors to the door. &ldquo;This is
      my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, I thought as much on seeing only one desk,&rdquo; McIntyre's manner
      grew more cordial. &ldquo;Does Rochester's furniture duplicate yours, safe and
      all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe&mdash;no, he has none; that is the firm's safe.&rdquo; Kent was becoming
      restless under so many personal questions. &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Clymer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget to-night at eight,&rdquo; the banker reminded him before stepping
      into the corridor. &ldquo;We'll dine at the Club de Vingt. Come along,
      McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester stopped Kent on his way back to his office and handed him the
      neatly typewritten copies of his brief, and with a word of thanks the
      lawyer went over to his desk and, gathering such papers as he required at
      the court house, he thrust them and the brief into his leather bag, but
      instead of hurrying on his way, he stood still to consider the events of
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen McIntyre, during their interview, had not responded to his appeal
      for her confidence, nor vouchsafed any reason for her belief that Jimmie
      Turnbull had been the victim of foul play. And Colonel McIntyre had given
      him only until Saturday night to solve the problem! Kent's overwrought
      feelings found vent in an emphatic oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; exclaimed Sylvester mildly from the doorway. &ldquo;I knocked and
      understood you to say come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; Kent's nerves were getting a bit raw; a glance at his
      watch showed him he had a slender margin only in which to reach the court
      house in time for his appointment. Not even waiting for the clerk's reply
      he snatched up his brief case and made for the private door leading into
      the corridor. But he was destined not to get away without another
      interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Sylvester was hastily explaining, &ldquo;Two gentlemen to see you, Mr. Kent,&rdquo;
       the clerk was thrust aside and Detective Ferguson entered, accompanied by
      a deputy marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to detain you, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; exclaimed the detective. &ldquo;I came to tell
      you that Coroner Penfield has just called an inquest for this afternoon to
      inquire into Jimmie Turnbull's death. Where's your partner, Mr.
      Rochester?&rdquo; looking around inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Cleveland. Won't I do?&rdquo; replied Kent, his appointment forgotten in the
      news that Ferguson had just given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we didn't come for legal advice,&rdquo; Ferguson smiled; then grew serious.
      &ldquo;What's Mr. Rochester's address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent walked over to his desk and picked up the telegram. &ldquo;The City Club,
      Cleveland,&rdquo; he stated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Ferguson jotted down the address in his note-book. &ldquo;Jones,
      here,&rdquo; placing his hand on his companion, &ldquo;came to serve Mr. Rochester
      with a subpoena; he's wanted at the Turnbull inquest as a material
      witness.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII. THE INQUEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Coroner Penfield adjusted his eyeglasses and scanned the spectators
      gathered for the Turnbull inquest. The room was crowded with both men and
      women, the latter predominating, and the coroner decided that, while some
      had come from a personal interest in the dead man, the majority had been
      attracted by morbid curiosity. There was a stir among the spectators as an
      inner door opened and the jury, led by the morgue master filed into the
      room and took their places. Coroner Penfield rose and addressed the
      foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you viewed the body?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doctor,&rdquo; and the man sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coroner Penfield then concisely stated the reason for the inquest and
      summoned Officer O'Ryan to the witness stand. The policeman stood, cap in
      hand, while being sworn by the morgue master, and then took his place on
      the platform in the chair reserved for the witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer to Coroner Penfield's questions relative to his name, residence
      in Washington, and length of service in the city Police Force were given
      with brevity and a rich Irish brogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you on Tuesday morning at about five o'clock?&rdquo; asked Penfield,
      first consulting some memoranda on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my way home,&rdquo; explained O'Ryan. &ldquo;My relief had just come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your beat take in the McIntyre residence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you observe any one loitering in the vicinity of the residence prior
      to five o'clock, Tuesday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. It was only when the lady called to me that I was attracted to
      the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she state what was the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. She said that she had locked a burglar in a closet, and to come
      and get him, and I did so,&rdquo; and O'Ryan expanded his chest with an air of
      satisfaction as be glanced about the morgue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the burglar resist arrest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; he came very peaceably and not a word out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you any idea that the burglar was not what he seemed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil an idea, begging your pardon&rdquo;&mdash;O'Ryan remembered hastily where
      he was. &ldquo;The burglar looked the part he was masquerading, and his make-up
      was perfect,&rdquo; ended O'Ryan with relish. &ldquo;Never gave me a hint he was a
      gentleman and a bank cashier in disguise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent, who had arrived at the morgue a few minutes before the policeman
      commenced his testimony, smiled in spite of himself. He was feeling
      exceedingly low spirited, and had come to the inquest with inward
      foreboding as to its result. On what developed there, he was convinced,
      hung Jimmie Turnbull's good name. After his interview with Detective
      Ferguson that morning, he had wired Philip Rochester to return to
      Washington at once. He had requested an immediate reply, and had fully
      expected to find a telegram at his office when he stopped there on his way
      to the morgue, but none had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did you see in the McIntyre house?&rdquo; the coroner asked O'Ryan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one sir, except the burglar and Miss McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find any doors or windows unlocked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I never looked to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the young lady said that she had been over the house and
      everything was then fastened.&rdquo; O'Ryan looked anxiously at the coroner.
      Would he make him out derelict in his duty? It would seriously affect his
      standing on the Force. &ldquo;I took Miss McIntyre's word for the house, for I
      had the burglar safe under arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did Miss McIntyre appear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appear? Sure, she looked very sweet in her blue wrapper and her hair down
      her back,&rdquo; answered O'Ryan with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was not fully dressed then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Miss McIntyre composed in manner or did she appear frightened?&rdquo; asked
      Penfield. It was one of the questions which Kent had expected, and he
      waited with intense interest for the policeman's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very pale and&mdash;and breathless like.&rdquo; O'Ryan flapped his arms
      about vaguely in his endeavor to demonstrate his meaning. &ldquo;She kept
      begging me to hurry and get the burglar out of the house, and after
      telling her that she would have to appear in the Police Court first thing
      that morning, I went off with the prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there lights in the house?&rdquo; questioned Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only dim ones in the halls and two bulbs turned on in the library; it's a
      big room though, and they hardly made any light at all,&rdquo; explained O'Ryan;
      he was particular as to details. &ldquo;I used handcuffs on the prisoner,
      thinking maybe he'd give me the slip in the dim light, but there was no
      fight or flight in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he talk to you on the way to the station house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; and at the station he was just as quiet, only answered the
      questions the desk sergeant put to him, and that was all,&rdquo; stated 0' Ryan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penfield laid down his memorandum pad. &ldquo;All right, O'Ryan; you may
      retire,&rdquo; and at the words the policeman left the platform and the room. He
      was followed by the police sergeant who had been on desk duty at the
      Eighth Precinct on Tuesday morning. His testimony simply corroborated
      O'Ryan's statement that the prisoner had done and said nothing which would
      indicate that he was other than he seemed&mdash;a housebreaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coroner Penfield paused before calling the next witness and drank a glass
      of ice water; the weather had turned unseasonably hot, and the room in
      which inquests were held, was stifling, in spite of the long opened
      windows at either end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call Miss Helen McIntyre,&rdquo; Penfield said to the morgue master, and the
      latter crossed to the door leading to the room where sat the witnesses.
      There was instant craning of necks to catch a glimpse of the society girl
      about whom, with her twin sister, so much interest centered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen was extremely pale as she advanced up the room, but Kent, watching
      her closely, was relieved to see none of the nervousness which had been so
      marked at their interview that morning. She was dressed with fastidious
      taste, and as she mounted the platform after the morgue master had
      administered the oath, Coroner Penfield rose and, with a polite gesture,
      indicated the chair she was to occupy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Helen McIntyre,&rdquo; she announced clearly. &ldquo;Daughter of Colonel Charles
      McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us the circumstances attending the arrest of James Turnbull, alias
      John Smith, in your house on Tuesday morning, Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; directed the
      coroner, seating himself at his table, on which were writing materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sitting up to let in my sister, who had gone to a dance,&rdquo; she
      began, &ldquo;and fearing I would fall asleep I went down into the library,
      intending to sit in one of the window recesses and watch for her arrival.
      As I entered the library I saw a figure steal across the room and
      disappear inside a closet. I was very frightened, but had sense enough
      left to cross softly to the closet and lock the door.&rdquo; She paused in her
      rapid recital and drew a long breath, then continued more slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hurried to the window and across the street I saw a policeman standing
      under a lamp-post. It took but a minute to call him. The policeman opened
      the closet door, put handcuffs on Mr. Turnbull and took him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coroner Penfield, as well as the jurors, followed her statement with
      absorbed attention. At its end he threw down his pencil and spoke briefly
      to the deputy coroner, who had been busily engaged in taking notes of the
      inquest, and then he turned to Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You heard no sound before entering the library?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one walking about the house?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; She followed the negative with a short explanation. &ldquo;I lay down on
      my bed soon after dinner, not feeling very well, and slept through the
      early hours of the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour did you wake up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About four o'clock, or a little after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were awake an hour before you discovered the supposed burglar in
      your library?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; Helen's hesitation was faint. &ldquo;About that length of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you heard no unusual sounds in that hour's interval?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard nothing&rdquo;&mdash;her manner was slightly defiant and Kent's heart
      sank; if he had only thought to warn her not to antagonize the coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you during that hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lying down,&rdquo; promptly. &ldquo;Then, afraid I would drop off to sleep again, I
      went downstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coroner Penfield consulted his notes before asking another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who lives in your house beside you and your twin sister?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, Colonel McIntyre; our house guest, Mrs. Louis C. Brewster, and
      five servants,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Grimes, the butler; Martha, our maid; Jane,
      the chambermaid; Hope, our cook; and Thomas, our second man; the
      chauffeur, Harris, the scullery maid, and the laundress do not stay at
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were at home beside yourself on Monday night and early Tuesday
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father and Mrs. Brewster; I believe the servants were in also, except
      Thomas, who had asked permission to spend the night in Baltimore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre?&rdquo; Coroner Penfield put the next question in an impressive
      manner. &ldquo;On discovering the burglar why did you not call your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My first impulse was to do so,&rdquo; she answered promptly. &ldquo;But on leaving
      the library I passed the window, saw the policeman, and called him in.&rdquo;
       She shot a keen look at the coroner, and added softly, &ldquo;The policeman was
      qualified to make an arrest; my father would have had to summon one had he
      been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite true,&rdquo; acknowledged Penfield courteously. &ldquo;Now, Miss McIntyre, why
      did the prisoner so obligingly walk straight into a closet on your arrival
      in the library?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume he was looking for a way out of the room and blundered into
      it,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;There are seven doors opening from our library; the
      prisoner may have heard me approaching, become confused, and walked
      through the wrong door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite plausible&mdash;with an ordinary bona-fide burglar,&rdquo; agreed
      Penfield. &ldquo;But was not Mr. Turnbull acquainted with the architectural
      arrangements of your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a frequent caller and an intimate friend,&rdquo; she said, with dignity.
      &ldquo;As to his power of observation and his bump of locality I cannot say. The
      library was but dimly lighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; Penfield spoke slowly. &ldquo;Were you aware of the real
      identity of the burglar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no suspicion that he was not what he appeared,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;He
      said or did nothing after his arrest to give me the slightest inkling of
      his identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield raised his eyebrows and shot a look at the deputy coroner before
      going on with his examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew Mr. Turnbull intimately, and yet you did not recognize him?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wore an admirable disguise.&rdquo; Helen touched her lips with the tip of
      her tongue; inwardly she longed for the glass of ice water which she saw
      standing on the reporters' table. &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull's associates will tell you
      that he excelled in amateur theatricals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield looked at her critically for a moment before continuing his
      questions. She bore his scrutiny with composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officer O'Ryan has testified that you informed him you examined the
      windows of your house,&rdquo; he said, after a brief wait. &ldquo;Did you find any
      unlocked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; one was open in the little reception room off the front door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What floor is the room on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ground floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it have been easy for any one to gain admittance through the window
      without attracting attention in the street?&rdquo; was Penfield's next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; Penfield rose, &ldquo;I have only a few more questions to put
      to you. Why did Mr. Turnbull come to your house&mdash;a house where he was
      a welcome visitor&mdash;in the middle of the night disguised as a
      burglar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporters as well as the spectators bent forward to catch her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull had a wager with my sister, Barbara,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;She
      bet him that he could not break into the house without being discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield considered her answer before addressing her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't Mr. Turnbull tell you who he was when you had him arrested?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I cannot answer that question, for I do not
      know his reason. If he had only confided in me&rdquo;&mdash;her voice shook&mdash;&ldquo;he
      might have been alive to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Penfield shot the question at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because then he would have been spared the additional excitement of his
      trip to the police station and the scene in court, which brought on his
      attack of angina pectoris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield regarded her for a moment in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no further questions, Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; he said, and turned to the
      morgue master. &ldquo;Ask Miss Barbara McIntyre to come to the platform.&rdquo;
       Turning back to his table and the papers thereon he failed to see the
      twins pass each other in the aisle. They were identically attired and when
      Coroner Penfield looked again at the witness chair, he stared in surprise
      at its occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, Miss McIntyre, I desire your sister to testify,&rdquo; he
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Barbara McIntyre.&rdquo; A haunting quality in her voice caught Kent's
      attention, and he leaned eagerly forward, his eyes following each movement
      of her nervous fingers, busily twisting her gloves inside and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; exclaimed the coroner, recovering from his surprise.
      He had seen the twins at the police court on Tuesday morning for a second
      only, and then his attention had been entirely centered on Helen. He had
      heard, but had not realized until that moment, how striking was the
      resemblance between the sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; the coroner cleared his throat and commenced his
      examination. &ldquo;Where were you on Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a dance given by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Grosvenor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour did you return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was half past five or a few minutes earlier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who let you in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the burglar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had left,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My sister told me of her adventure as we
      went upstairs to our rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; Penfield picked up a page of the deputy coroner's closely
      written notes, and ran his eyes down it. &ldquo;Your sister has testified that
      James Turnbull went to your house disguised as a burglar on a wager with
      you. What were the terms of that wager?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet him that he could not enter the house after midnight without his
      presence being detected by our new police dogs,&rdquo; exclaimed Barbara slowly.
      She had stopped twirling her gloves about, and one hand was firmly
      clenched over the arm of her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the dogs discover his presence in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently not, or they would have aroused the household,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      cannot answer that question, though, because I was not at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the dogs kept?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the garage in the daytime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at night?&rdquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They roam about our house,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;or sleep in the boudoir, which
      is between my sister's bedroom and mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were the dogs in the house on Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not see them on my return from the dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not an answer to my question, Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; the coroner pointed
      out. &ldquo;Were the dogs in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a distinct pause before she spoke. &ldquo;I recall hearing our butler,
      Grimes, say that he found the dogs in the cellar. Mr. Turnbull's shocking
      death put all else out of my mind; I never once thought of the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In spite of the fact that it was a wager over the dogs which brought
      about the whole situation?&rdquo; remarked the coroner dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara flushed at his tone, then grew pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I honestly forgot about the dogs,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Father sent them out to
      our country place Tuesday afternoon; they annoyed our&mdash;our guest,
      Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By barking&mdash;'they are noisy dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet they did not arouse the household when Mr. Turnbull broke into
      the house&rdquo;&mdash;Coroner Penfield regarded her sternly. &ldquo;How do you
      account for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara's right hand stole to the arm of her chair and clasped it with the
      same convulsive strength that she clung to the other chair arm. When she
      spoke her voice was barely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can account for it in two ways,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;If the dogs were
      accidentally locked in the cellar they could not possibly hear Mr.
      Turnbull moving about the house; if they were roaming about and scented
      him, they might not have barked because they would recognize him as a
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were the dogs familiar with his step and voice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Only last Sunday he played with them for an hour, and later in the
      afternoon took them for a walk in the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Penfield stroked his chin reflectively. &ldquo;When your sister told
      you of finding the burglar and his arrest, did you not, in the light of
      your wager, suspect that he might be Mr. Turnbull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Barbara's eyes did not falter before his direct gaze. &ldquo;I supposed
      that Mr. Turnbull meant to try and enter the house in his own proper
      person; it never dawned on me that he would resort to disguise. Besides,&rdquo;
       as the coroner started to make a remark, &ldquo;we have had numerous robberies
      in our neighborhood, and the apartment house two blocks from us has had a
      regular epidemic of sneak thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coroner waited until Dr. Mayo, who had been writing with feverish
      haste, had picked up a fresh sheet of paper before resuming his
      examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accompanied your sister to the police court,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you see
      the burglar there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you realize his identity in the court room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I only awoke to&mdash;to the situation when I saw him lying dead with
      his wig removed. The shock was frightful&rdquo;&mdash;she closed her eyes for a
      second, for the room and the rows of faces confronting her were mixed in a
      maddening maze and she raised her hand to her swimming head. When she
      looked up she found Coroner Penfield by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;Please remain in the witness room, I may
      call you again,&rdquo; and he helped her down the step with careful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in his corner Kent watched her departure. He was white to the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heat too much for you?&rdquo; asked a kindly-faced stranger, and Kent gave a
      mumbled &ldquo;No,&rdquo; as he strove to pull himself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      What deviltry was afoot? How dared the twins take such risks&mdash;to bear
      false witness was a grave criminal offense. He, alone, among all the
      spectators, had realized that in testifying before the inquest, the twins
      had swapped identities.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &ldquo;B-B-B&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The return of the morgue master to the platform caused Coroner Penfield to
      break off his whispered conversation with Dr. Mayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre just telephoned that his car had a blow-out on the way
      here,&rdquo; explained the morgue master. &ldquo;He will arrive shortly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield consulted a list of names. &ldquo;Call Grimes, the McIntyre butler,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;We will hear him while waiting for the Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grimes, small and thin, with the stolid countenance of the well-trained
      servant, was exceedingly short in his replies to the coroner's questions.
      Yes, he had lived with the McIntyre during their residence in Washington,
      something like five years, he couldn't quite remember the exact dates. No,
      there was never any quarreling, upstairs or down; it was a well-ordered
      household until this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; remarked the coroner dryly. &ldquo;What about Monday night? Tell us,
      Grimes, what occurred in that house between midnight Monday and five
      o'clock Tuesday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't much to tell,&rdquo; was the grumpy response. &ldquo;I went upstairs about
      half-past eleven and got down the next morning at the usual hour, seven
      o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you heard no disturbing sounds in the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; sir. We wouldn't be likely to; the servants' rooms are all at the top
      of the house and the staircase leading to them has a brick wall on either
      side, like stairs leading to an ordinary attic, and there's a door at the
      bottom which shuts off all sound from below.&rdquo; It was the longest sentence
      the butler had indulged in and he paused for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who closes the house at night. Grimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave the window in the reception room open?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't, sir,&rdquo; was the prompt denial. &ldquo;I had just locked it when Mrs.
      Brewster came in, along with Colonel McIntyre and Mr. Clymer, and they sat
      down to talk. When I left the room the window was locked fast, and so was
      every door and window in the place,&rdquo; he declared aggressively. &ldquo;I'll take
      my dying oath to it, sir.&rdquo; Penfield looked at Grimes; that he was telling
      the truth was unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sits up to let in the young ladies when they go to balls?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generally no one, sir, because Colonel McIntyre accompanies them or calls
      for them, and he has his latch-key. Lately,&rdquo; added Grimes as an
      after-thought, &ldquo;Miss Helen has been using a duplicate latch-key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Miss Barbara McIntyre a latch-key, also?&rdquo; asked Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I believe not,&rdquo; the butler looked dubious. &ldquo;I recall that
      Colonel McIntyre gave Miss Helen her key at the luncheon table, and he
      said, then, to Miss Barbara that he couldn't trust her with one because
      she would be sure to lose it, she is that careless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coroner asked the next question with such abruptness that the butler
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you last see Mr. Turnbull at the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunday afternoon.&rdquo; Grimes' reply was spoken with more than his accustomed
      quickness of speech. &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull called twice, after a long time in the
      drawing room, he went away taking the police dogs with him, and later
      called to bring them back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were these dogs on Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I last saw them in the library,&rdquo; replied Grimes shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did you find them the next morning?&rdquo; prompted the coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the cellar,&rdquo; laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what were they doing in the cellar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunting rats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did the dogs get in the cellar?&rdquo; inquired the coroner patiently.
      Grimes was not volunteering information, even if he could not be accused
      of holding it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one must have let them down the back stairs,&rdquo; the butler admitted.
      &ldquo;I don't know who it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which servant got downstairs ahead of you on Tuesday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, sir; the cook over-slept, and she and the maids came down in a
      bunch ten minutes later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who told you of the attempted burglary and the burglar's arrest?&rdquo;
       asked Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Barbara. She asked us to hurry breakfast for her and Miss Helen
      'cause they had to go at once to the police court; she didn't give any
      particulars, or nothing,&rdquo; added Grimes in an injured tone. &ldquo;'Twarn't 'til
      Thomas and I saw the afternoon papers that we knew what had been going on
      in our own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, Grimes,&rdquo; announced Penfield, and the butler left the
      platform with the same stolid air he wore when he arrived. He was followed
      in the witness chair by the other McIntyre servants in succession. Their
      testimony added nothing to what he had said but simply confirmed his
      statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent, who had grown restless during the servants' monotonous testimony,
      forgot the oppressive atmosphere of the room on seeing Mrs. Brewster enter
      under the escort of the morgue master. Spying a vacant seat several rows
      ahead of where he was sitting, Kent, with a muttered apology to the people
      over whom he crawled in his efforts to get out, hurried into it just as
      the vivacious widow had finished taking the oath to &ldquo;tell the truth and
      nothing but the truth,&rdquo; and seated herself, with much rustling of silk
      skirts in the witness chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;State your full name, madam,&rdquo; directed Coroner Penfield, eyeing her
      dainty beauty with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret Perry Brewster,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Widow of Louis C. Brewster. Both
      I and my late husband were born and lived in Los Angeles, California.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you visiting the Misses McIntyre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster spoke in a chatty impersonal manner. &ldquo;I have been
      with them since the first of the month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you attend the Grosvenor dance?&rdquo; asked the coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the affair was only given for the debutantes of last fall and did not
      include married people,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It was a warm night and Colonel
      McIntyre asked Mr. Benjamin Clymer, who was dining with him, and me, to go
      for a motor ride, leaving Barbara at the Grosvenors' en route. We did so,
      returning to the house about eleven o'clock, and sat talking until about
      midnight in the reception room, then Colonel McIntyre drove Mr. Clymer
      home, and I went to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you awakened by any noises during the night?&rdquo; inquired Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I heard no noises.&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster's charming smile was infectious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you first learn of the supposed burglary and the death of James
      Turnbull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The McIntyre twins told me about the tragedy on their return from the
      police court,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Brewster, and settled herself a little more
      comfortably in the witness chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you were in the reception room, Mrs. Brewster&rdquo;&mdash;Penfield paused
      and studied his notes a second&mdash;&ldquo;did you observe if the window was
      open or closed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not open when we entered,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;But the air in the room
      was stuffy and at my request Mr. Clymer raised the window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he close it later?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered the question. &ldquo;I really do not recall,&rdquo; she admitted
      finally. Her eyes strayed toward the door through which she had entered,
      and Penfield answered her unspoken thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one more question,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;Did you see the dogs on
      Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I heard them scratching at the door leading to the basement as I
      went upstairs, and so I turned around and went down and opened the door
      and let them run down into the cellar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield snapped shut his notebook. &ldquo;I am greatly obliged, Mrs. Brewster;
      we will not detain you longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The morgue master stepped forward and helped the pretty widow down from
      the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre is here now,&rdquo; he told the coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, then bring him in,&rdquo; and Penfield, while awaiting the arrival of the
      new witness, straightened the papers on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre looked straight ahead of him as he walked down the room and stood
      frowning heavily while the oath was being administered, but his manner,
      when the coroner addressed him, had regained all the suavity and polish
      which had first captivated Washington society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been a resident of Washington for about five years,&rdquo; he said in
      answer to the coroner's question. &ldquo;My daughters attended school here after
      their return from Paris, where they were in a convent for four years. They
      made their debut last November at our home in this city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you aware of the wager between your daughter Barbara and James
      Turnbull?&rdquo; asked Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of it Sunday afternoon but paid little attention,&rdquo; admitted
      McIntyre. &ldquo;My daughter Barbara's vagaries I seldom take seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Mr. Turnbull a frequent visitor at your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he engaged to your daughter Helen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; McIntyre's denial was prompt and firmly spoken. Penfield and Kent,
      from his new seat nearer the platform, watched the colonel narrowly, but
      learned nothing from his expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard otherwise,&rdquo; observed the coroner dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been misinformed,&rdquo; McIntyre's manner was short. &ldquo;I would
      suggest, Mr. Coroner, that you confine your questions and conjectures to
      matters pertinent to this inquiry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield flushed as one of the jurors snickered, but he did not repeat his
      previous question, asking instead, &ldquo;Was there good feeling between you and
      Mr. Turnbull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never quarreled with him,&rdquo; replied McIntyre. &ldquo;I really saw little of
      him as, whenever he called at the house, he came to see one or the other
      of my daughters, or both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you last see Mr. Turnbull?&rdquo; inquired Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was at the house on Sunday and I had quite a talk with him,&rdquo; McIntyre
      leaned back in his chair and regarded the neat crease in his trousers with
      critical eyes. &ldquo;I last saw Turnbull going out of the street door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you disturbed by the burglar's entrance on Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre shook his head. &ldquo;I am a heavy sleeper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I regret very
      much that my daughter Helen did not at once awaken me on finding the
      burglar, as she supposed, hiding in the closet. I knew nothing of the
      affair until Grimes informed me of it, and only reached the police court
      in time to bring my daughters home from the distressing scene following
      the identification of the dead burglar as Jimmie Turnbull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre,&rdquo; Penfield turned over several papers until he found the
      one he sought. &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster has testified that while you and she were
      sitting in the reception room, Mr. Clymer opened the window. Did you close
      it on leaving the room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre reflected before answering. &ldquo;I cannot remember doing so,&rdquo; he
      stated finally. &ldquo;Clymer was in rather a hurry to leave, and after bidding
      Mrs. Brewster good night, we went straight out to the car and I drove him
      to the Saratoga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you cannot swear to the window having been re-locked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield paused a moment. &ldquo;Did you return immediately to your house from
      the Saratoga apartment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did&rdquo; promptly. &ldquo;My chauffeur, Harris, wasn't well, and I wanted him to
      get home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield thought a moment before putting the next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did Miss Barbara return from the Grosvenor dance?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was brought home by friends, Colonel and Mrs. Chase.&rdquo; McIntyre in
      turning about in his chair knocked down his walking stick from its resting
      place against its side, and the unexpected clatter made several women,
      nervously inclined, jump in their seats. Observing them, McIntyre smiled
      and was still smiling amusedly when Penfield addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you observe many lights burning in your house when you returned?&rdquo;
       asked Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only those which are usually left lit at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was your daughter Helen awake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know. Her room was in darkness when I walked past her door on my
      way to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield removed his eye-glasses and polished them on his silk
      handkerchief. &ldquo;I have no further questions to ask. Colonel, you are
      excused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre bowed gravely to him and as he left the platform came face to
      face with his family physician, Dr. Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penfield, who was an old acquaintance of the physician's, signed to him to
      come on the platform. After the preliminaries had been gone through, he
      shifted his chair around, the better to face Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you accompany the Misses McIntyre to the police court on Tuesday
      morning?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; responded the physician, &ldquo;at Miss Barbara's request. She said her
      sister was not very well and they disliked going alone to the police
      court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she state why she did not ask her father to go with them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that he had not fully recovered from an attack of tonsillitis, which
      I knew to be a fact, and they did not want him to over-tax his strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's pause as the coroner, his attention diverted by a
      whispered word or two from the morgue master, referred to his notes before
      resuming his examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know James Turnbull?&rdquo; he asked a second later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, slightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you recognize him in his burglar's disguise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you any suspicion that the burglar was other than he seemed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield picked up a memorandum handed him by Dr. Mayo and referred to it.
      &ldquo;I understand, doctor, that you were the first to go to the burglar's aid
      when he became ill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone spoke with more animation. &ldquo;Happening to glance inside the
      cage where the prisoner sat, I saw he was struggling convulsively for
      breath. With Mr. Clymer's assistance I carried him into an ante-room off
      the court, but before I had crossed its threshold Turnbull expired in my
      arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he conscious before he died?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the question Kent bent eagerly forward. What would be the reply?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not prepared to answer that with certainty,&rdquo; replied Dr. Stone
      cautiously. &ldquo;As I picked him up I heard him stammer faintly: 'B-b-b.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent started so violently that the man next to him turned and regarded him
      for a moment, then, more interested in what was transpiring on the
      platform, promptly forgot his agitated neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Turnbull delirious, doctor?&rdquo; asked the coroner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone shook his head in denial. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;I take it that he
      started to say 'Barbara,' and his breath failed him; at any rate I only
      caught the stuttered 'B-b-b.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield did not immediately continue his examination, but when he did so
      his manner was stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, what in your opinion caused Mr. Turnbull's death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging superficially&mdash;I made no thorough examination,&rdquo; Stone
      explained parenthetically, &ldquo;I should say that Mr. Rochester was right when
      he stated that Turnbull died from an acute attack of angina pectoris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did Mr. Rochester come to make that assertion and where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately after Turnbull's death,&rdquo; replied Stone. &ldquo;Mr. Rochester, who
      shared his apartment, defended him in court. Mr. Rochester was aware that
      Turnbull suffered from the disease, and Mr. Clymer, who was present, also
      knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is your opinion, doctor?&rdquo; questioned Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone hesitated. &ldquo;There was a distinct odor of amyl nitrite noticeable
      when I went to Turnbull's aid, and I concluded then that he had some heart
      trouble and had inhaled the drug to ward off an attack. It bears out Mr.
      Rochester's theory of death from angina pectoris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Thank you, doctor. Please wait with the other witnesses; we may
      call you again,&rdquo; and with a sigh the busy physician resigned himself to
      spending another hour in the room reserved for the witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next to take the witness stand was Deputy Marshal Grant. His testimony
      was short and concise,&mdash;and his description of the scene in the
      police court preceding Turnbull's death was listened to with deep
      attention by every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the prisoner show any symptoms of illness before his heart attack?&rdquo;
       asked Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly illness,&rdquo; replied Grant slowly. &ldquo;I noticed he didn't move
      very quickly; sort of shambled, as if he was weak in his legs. I've seen
      'drunk and disorderlies' act just that way, and paid no particular
      attention to him. He did ask for a drink of water just after he returned
      to the cage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give it to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, an attendant gave the glass to Mr. Rochester who handed it to Mr.
      Turnbull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield regarded Grant in silence for a minute. &ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; he
      announced, and with a polite bow the deputy marshal withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detective Ferguson recognized Kent as he passed up the room to the
      platform and gave him a slight bow and smile, but the smile had
      disappeared when, at the coroner's request, he told of his arrival just
      after the discovery of the burglar's identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I searched the cage where the prisoner had been seated and found this
      handkerchief,&rdquo; he went on to say. &ldquo;It had been dropped by Turnbull and was
      saturated with amyl nitrite. I had it examined by a chemist, who said that
      this amyl nitrite was given to patients with heart trouble in little pearl
      capsules to be crushed in handkerchiefs and the fumes inhaled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chemist also told me that&rdquo;&mdash;the detective spoke with impressive
      seriousness, &ldquo;judging from the number of particles of capsules adhering to
      the linen, more than one capsule had been crushed by Turnbull. Here is the
      handkerchief,&rdquo; and he laid it on the table with great care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent's heart sank; the moment he had dreaded all that long afternoon had
      come. Penfield inspected the handkerchief with interest, and then passed
      it to the jurors, cautioning them to handle it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I note,&rdquo; he stated, turning again to Detective Ferguson, &ldquo;that it is a
      woman's handkerchief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Ferguson. &ldquo;And embroidered in one corner is the initial
      'B.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield ran his fingers through his gray hair. &ldquo;You may go, Ferguson,&rdquo; he
      said, and beckoned to the morgue master. &ldquo;Ask Miss Barbara McIntyre to
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was quick in answering the summons. Kent, more and more worried,
      was watching the scene with painful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mr. Turnbull have one of your handkerchiefs?&rdquo; asked Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her surprise at the question was manifest in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have a dreadful habit of dropping my
      handkerchiefs around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you miss one after his visit to your house on Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre,&rdquo; Penfield took up the handkerchief which the foreman
      replaced on his desk a moment before, and holding it with care extended it
      toward the girl. &ldquo;Is this your handkerchief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She inspected the handkerchief and the initial with curiosity, but with
      nothing more, Kent was convinced, and in his relief was almost guilty of
      disturbing the decorum of the inquest with a shout of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my handkerchief,&rdquo; she stated clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penfield replaced the handkerchief on the table with the same care he had
      picked it up, and turned again to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss McIntyre; I won't detain you longer. Logan,&rdquo; to the
      morgue master, &ldquo;ask Dr. Stone to step here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately Stone reentered the room and hurried to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would two or more capsules of amyl nitrite constitute a lethal dose?&rdquo;
       asked Penfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would be very apt to finish a feeble heart,&rdquo; replied Stone. &ldquo;Three
      capsules, if inhaled deeply would certainly kill a healthy person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Penfield showed the handkerchief to the physician. &ldquo;Can a chemist tell,
      from the particles clinging to this handkerchief, how many capsules have
      been used?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say he could.&rdquo; Stone looked grave as he inspected the linen,
      taking careful note of the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; in one corner of the handkerchief.
      &ldquo;But there is this to be considered&mdash;Turnbull may not have crushed
      those capsules all at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have felt an attack coming on earlier in the evening and used a
      capsule, and in the police court used the same handkerchief in the same
      manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Penfield nodded. &ldquo;The point is cleverly taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent silently agreed with the coroner. The next instant Stone was excused,
      and after a slight pause the deputy coroner, Dr. Mayo, left his table and
      his notes and occupied the witness chair, after first being sworn. The
      preliminaries did not consume much time, and Penfield's manner was brisk
      as he addressed his assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you make a post-mortem examination of Turnbull?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, sir, in the presence of the morgue master and Dr. McLane.&rdquo; Dr.
      Mayo displayed an anatomical chart, drawing his pencil down it as he
      talked. &ldquo;We found from the condition of the heart that the deceased had
      suffered from angina pectoris&rdquo;&mdash;he paused and spoke more slowly&mdash;&ldquo;in
      examining the gastric contents we found the presence of aconitine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aconitine?&rdquo; questioned Penfield, and the reporters, scenting the
      sensational, leaned forward eagerly so as not to miss the deputy coroner's
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aconitine, an active poison,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It is the alkaloid of
      aconite, and generally fatal in its results.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. AT THE CLUB DE VINGT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The large building of the popular Club de Vingt, or as one Washingtonian
      put it, the &ldquo;Club De Vin,&rdquo; which had sprung into existence in the National
      Capital during the war, was ablaze with light and Benjamin Clymer, sitting
      at a small table in one corner of the dining-room, wished most heartily
      that it had been less crowded. Many dinner-parties were being given that
      night, and it was only by dint of perseverance and a Treasury note that he
      had finally induced the head waiter to put in an extra table for him and
      his guest, Harry Kent. Kent had been very late and, to add to his
      short-comings, had been silent, not to say morose, during dinner. Clymer
      heaved a sigh of relief when the table was cleared and coffee and cigars
      placed before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent roused himself from his abstraction. &ldquo;We cannot talk here,&rdquo; he said,
      looking at the gay diners who surrounded them. &ldquo;And I have several
      important matters to discuss with you, Mr. Clymer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His remark was overheard by their waiter, and he stopped pouring out
      Kent's coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a small smoking room to the right of the dining room,&rdquo; he
      suggested. &ldquo;I passed there but a moment ago and it was not occupied. If
      you desire, sir, I will serve coffee there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An excellent idea.&rdquo; Clymer rose quickly and he and Kent followed the
      waiter to the inclosed porch which had been converted into an attractive
      lounging room for the club members. It was much cooler than the
      over-heated dining room, and Kent was grateful for the subdued light given
      out by the artistically shaded lamps with which it was furnished. There
      was silence while the waiter with deft fingers arranged the coffee and
      cigars on a wicker table; then receiving Clymer's generous tip with a word
      of thanks, the man departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent wheeled his chair around so as to face his companion and still have a
      side view of the dining room, where tables were being rapidly removed for
      the dance which followed dinners on Thursday nights. Clymer selected a
      cigar with care and, leaning back in his chair until the wicker creaked
      under his weight, he waited patiently for Kent to speak. It was fully five
      minutes before Kent addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So James Turnbull was poisoned after all,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;A week ago I
      would have sworn that Jimmie hadn't an enemy in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but he had; and a very bitter vindictive enemy, if the evidence given
      at the coroner's inquest this afternoon is to be believed,&rdquo; replied Clymer
      seriously. &ldquo;The case is remarkably puzzling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Kent bit savagely at his cigar as a slight vent to his feelings.
      &ldquo;'Killed by a dose of aconitine by a person or persons unknown,' was the
      jury's verdict, and a nice tangle they have left me to ferret out.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I'm going to solve this mystery if it is a possible thing.&rdquo; Kent's
      tone was grim. &ldquo;And Colonel McIntyre only gave me until Saturday night to
      work in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer eyed him in surprise. &ldquo;McIntyre desires to get back his lost
      securities; judging from his comments after the inquest, he is not
      particularly interested in who killed Turnbull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am,&rdquo; exclaimed Kent. &ldquo;The more I think of it, the more convinced I
      am that the forged letter, with the subsequent disappearance of McIntyre's
      securities has some connection with Jimmie's untimely death, be it murder
      or suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suicide?&rdquo; Clymer's raised eyebrows indicated his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; shortly. &ldquo;Aconitine would have killed just as surely if swallowed
      with suicidal intent as if administered with murderous design.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause followed which neither man seemed anxious to break, then Kent
      turned to the banker, and the latter noticed the haggard lines in his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Mr. Clymer,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;My instinct tells me that Jimmie
      Turnbull never forged that letter or stole McIntyre's securities, but I
      admit that everything points to his guilt, even his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the theft of the securities supplies a motive for his suicide&mdash;fear
      of exposure and imprisonment,&rdquo; argued Kent. &ldquo;But there is no motive, so
      far as I can see, for Jimmie's murder. Men don't kill each other without a
      motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is homicidal mania,&rdquo; suggested Clymer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not in this case,&rdquo; retorted Kent. &ldquo;We are sane men and it is up to us
      to find out if Jimmie died by his own hand or was killed by some unknown
      enemy.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest easy, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; said a voice from the doorway and Kent, who had
      turned his back in that direction the better to talk to Clymer, whirled
      around and found Detective Ferguson regarding him just inside the
      threshold. &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull's enemy is not unknown and will soon be under
      arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; demanded Clymer and Kent simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip Rochester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer was the first to recover from his astonishment. &ldquo;Oh, get out!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed incredulously. &ldquo;Why, Rochester was Turnbull's most intimate
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until they fell in love with the same girl,&rdquo; answered Ferguson
      succinctly, taking possession of the only other chair the porch boasted.
      &ldquo;One quarrel led to another and then Rochester did for him. Oh, it
      dove-tails nicely; motive, jealous anger; opportunity, recognition in
      court of Turnbull disguised as a burglar, at the same time Rochester
      learns that Turnbull has been caught after midnight in the house of his
      sweetheart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;mn you!&rdquo; Kent sprang for the detective's throat. &ldquo;Cut out your
      abominable insinuations. Miss McIntyre shall not be insulted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not insulting her,&rdquo; gasped Ferguson, half strangled. &ldquo;Let go, Mr.
      Kent. I'm only telling you what that half crazy partner of yours,
      Rochester, was probably thinking in the police court. Let go, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer aided the detective in freeing himself. &ldquo;Sit down, Kent,&rdquo; he said
      sternly. &ldquo;Ferguson meant no offense. Go ahead, man, and tell us the rest
      of your theories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was some minutes, however, before the detective had collected
      sufficient breath to answer intelligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I size it up this way,&rdquo; he began with a resentful glance at Kent who had
      dropped back in his chair again. &ldquo;Rochester knew his friend had heart
      disease and that his sudden death would be attributed to it&mdash;so he
      took a sporting chance and administered a fatal dose of aconitine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was it done?&rdquo; asked Clymer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just slipped the poison into the glass of water he handed to Turnbull in
      the court room,&rdquo; explained Ferguson, and glanced in triumph at Kent.
      &ldquo;Neat, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent regarded the detective, his mind in a whirl. His theory was certainly
      plausible, but&mdash;&ldquo;Have you other evidence to prove, your theory?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Ferguson checked off his points on his fingers. &ldquo;Remember how
      insistent Mr. Rochester was that Turnbull had died from angina pectoris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; acknowledged Clymer, deeply interested. &ldquo;Continue, Ferguson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective needed no second bidding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another point,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;There never would have been a post-mortem
      examination if Miss Helen McIntyre hadn't asked for it. She knew of the
      ill-feeling between the men and suspected foul play on Rochester's part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; commanded Kent. &ldquo;Has Miss McIntyre substantiated that statement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; admitted Ferguson. &ldquo;I stopped at her house, but the butler said
      the young ladies had retired and could not see any one.&rdquo; Kent, who had
      called there on the way to keep his dinner engagement with Clymer, had
      been met with the same statement, to his bitter disappointment. He most
      earnestly desired to see the twins and to see them together, to make one
      more effort to induce them to confide in him; for that they had some
      secret trouble he was convinced; he longed to be of aid, but his hands
      were tied through lack of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't imply motives to Miss McIntyre's act until you have verified them,
      Ferguson,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;Go on with your theories.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; Clymer broke into the conversation. &ldquo;Did Rochester tell you,
      Ferguson, that he had recognized Turnbull in his burglar disguise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I never had an opportunity to ask him, for he disappeared
      Tuesday night and has not been seen or heard of since,&rdquo; Ferguson rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Kent checked him with an impatient gesture. &ldquo;I had a telegram
      from Rochester this morning, stating he was in Cleveland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't forget about the telegram,&rdquo; retorted Ferguson. &ldquo;It was to
      consult you about that, that I hunted you up to-night. That telegram was
      bogus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Kent half rose from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. After the inquest I called Cleveland on the long distance, talked
      with the City Club officials and with Police Headquarters; all declared
      that Rochester was not there, and no trace could be found of his having
      ever arrived in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer laid down his half smoked cigar and stared at the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think then that Rochester has bolted?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks that way,&rdquo; insisted Ferguson. &ldquo;How about it, Mr. Kent?&rdquo; The
      question was put with a touch of arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent did not reply immediately. Every fact that Ferguson had brought out
      fitted the situation, and Rochester's disappearance added color to the
      detective's charges. Why was he hiding unless from guilty motives, and
      where had he gone? Kent shook a bewildered head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is plausible,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;but, after all, only circumstantial
      evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, circumstantial evidence is good enough for me to work on,&rdquo; retorted
      Ferguson. &ldquo;On discovering that the telegram from Cleveland was a hoax, I
      concluded Ferguson might be lurking around Washington and so sent a
      description of him to the different precincts and secured a search
      warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Armed with it I visited Mr. Rochester's apartment, but couldn't find
      a clew to his present whereabouts,&rdquo; admitted Ferguson. &ldquo;So then I went to
      your office, Mr. Kent, and ransacked the firm's safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you!&rdquo; Kent leaned forward in his wrath and shook his fist at the
      detective. &ldquo;What right had you to do such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The search warrant covered it,&rdquo; explained Ferguson. &ldquo;I could look through
      your safe, Mr. Kent, because Rochester was your senior partner and you
      shared the office together; I was within the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you were,&rdquo; Kent controlled his anger with an effort. &ldquo;But I had
      told you I did not know Rochester's whereabouts before I showed you the
      Cleveland telegram, which you claim is bogus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's bogus, all right,&rdquo; insisted the detective. &ldquo;I thought it just
      possible I might find some paper which would give me a clew to Rochester's
      hiding place, so I went through the safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get it open?&rdquo; asked Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent leapt to his feet. &ldquo;You&mdash;found&mdash;it open!&rdquo;&mdash;he
      stammered. &ldquo;Why, man, I locked that safe securely just before I left the
      office at six o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all alone. Sylvester left at five o'clock&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knew the combination of the safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only Rochester and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Ferguson's turn to spring up &ldquo;By&mdash;!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought
      the electric bulbs in the office felt warm, as if they had recently been
      burning&mdash;Rochester must have been there just before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem that Rochester is still in the city,&rdquo; remarked Clymer. &ldquo;Do
      you know, Kent, whether he had his office keys with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I presume so,&rdquo; Kent slipped his hand inside his pocket and took out a
      bunch of keys. &ldquo;He left these duplicates in his desk at the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure they are duplicates?&rdquo; questioned Ferguson, and Kent flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they are,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Rochester had them made over a year ago
      as a matter of convenience, for he was always forgetting his keys, and
      kept these at our office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a queer cuss,&rdquo; was the detective's only comment and Clymer broke
      into the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you find any address or paper in the safe which might prove a clew,
      Ferguson?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, not even a scrap of paper,&rdquo; and the detective's tone was glum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the safe look as if its contents had been tumbled about?&rdquo; asked Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, everything seemed in order.&rdquo; Ferguson thrust his hand inside his coat
      pocket. &ldquo;There was one envelope in the right hand compartment which
      puzzled me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on&mdash;was that compartment also unlocked?&rdquo; asked Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; not giving Kent time to speak again Ferguson continued his
      remarks. &ldquo;As this was unaddressed I brought it to you, Mr. Kent, to ask if
      it was your personal property&rdquo;&mdash;he drew out the white envelope which
      Helen McIntyre had brought Kent that morning and turned it over so that
      both men could see the large red seal bearing the letter &ldquo;B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my property,&rdquo; asserted Kent instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind opening it?&rdquo; asked Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would, most certainly; it relates to my personal affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson looked a trifle non-plussed. &ldquo;Would you mind telling me its
      contents, Mr. Kent?&rdquo; he asked persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent regarded the detective squarely. He could not betray Helen, the
      envelope might contain harmless nonsense, but she had placed it in his
      safe-keeping&mdash;no, confound it, she had left it in the safe for
      Rochester&mdash;and Rochester was apparently a fugitive from justice,
      while circumstantial evidence pointed to his having poisoned Helen's
      lover, Jimmie...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you must know, Ferguson,&rdquo; Kent spoke with deliberation. &ldquo;They are old
      love letters of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer glanced down at the envelope which the detective still held, the
      red seal making a distinct blotch of color on the white, glazed surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Kent,&rdquo; he said in amusement. &ldquo;So rumor is right in predicting your
      engagement to Barbara McIntyre. Good luck to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the open doorway to the dining room where the dancing had ceased
      for the moment, came a soft laugh and Mrs. Brewster looked in at them.
      McIntyre, standing like her shadow, gazed in curiosity over her shoulder
      at the three men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How jolly to find you,&rdquo; cooed Mrs. Brewster. &ldquo;And what a charming
      retreat! It's much too nice to be occupied by men, only.&rdquo; She inclined her
      head in a little gracious bow to Ferguson and stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have my chair,&rdquo; suggested Clymer hospitably as the pretty widow raised
      her lorgnette and scanned the Oriental hangings and lamps, and lastly, the
      white envelope which lay on the table, red seal uppermost, where Ferguson
      had placed it on her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your daughters here, Colonel McIntyre?&rdquo; asked Kent as he took a step
      toward the table. McIntyre's answer was drowned in an outburst of cheering
      in the dining room and the rush of many feet. On common impulse Kent and
      the others turned toward the doorway and looked inside the dining room.
      Two officers of the French High Commission were being held on the
      shoulders of comrades and were delivering, as best they could amidst
      cheers and applause, their farewell to hospitable Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his companions brushed by him to join the gay throng in the center of
      the room, Kent turned back to pick up the envelope he had left lying on
      the table. It was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In feverish haste Kent looked under the table, under the chairs, the
      lounge and its cushions, behind the draperies, and even under the rugs
      which covered the floor of the porch, and then rose and stared into the
      dining room. Which one of his companions had taken the envelope?
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the porch the beautiful trumpet vine, its sturdy trunk and thick
      branches reaching almost to the roof of the club building, rustled as in a
      high wind, and the branches swayed this way and that as a figure climbed
      swiftly down from the porch until, reaching the fence separating the club
      property from its neighbor's, the man swung across it, no mean athletic
      feet, and taking advantage of each sheltering shadow, darted into the
      alley and from there down silent, deserted Nineteenth Street.

      CHAPTER XI. HALF A TRUTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dancing was being resumed in the dining room as Kent appeared again in the
      doorway and he made his way as quickly as possible among the couples,
      going into all the rooms on that floor, but nowhere could he find
      Detective Ferguson. On emerging from the drawing room, he encountered the
      steward returning from downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Clymer?&rdquo; he asked hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Kent; he just left the club, taking Detective Ferguson with him
      in his motor. Is there anything I can do?&rdquo; added the steward observing
      Kent's agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, thanks. Say, where is Colonel McIntyre?&rdquo; Kent gave up further
      pursuit of the detective, he could find him later at Headquarters. The
      steward looked among the dancers. &ldquo;I don't see him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;But there
      is Mrs. Brewster dancing in the front room; the Colonel must be somewhere
      around. If I meet him, Mr. Kent, shall I tell him you are looking for
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be greatly obliged if you will do so,&rdquo; replied Kent, and
      straightening his tie, he went in quest of the pretty widow. He had found
      her a merry chatter-box in the past, possibly he could gain valuable
      information from her. He found Mrs. Brewster just completing her dance
      with a fine looking Italian officer whose broad breast bore many military
      decorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dance the encore with me&rdquo;&mdash;Kent could be very persuasive when he
      wished, and Mrs. Brewster dimpled with pleasure, but there was a faint
      indecision in her manner which he was quick to note. What prompted it? He
      had been on friendly terms with her; in fact, she had openly championed
      his cause, so Barbara had once told him, when Colonel McIntyre had made
      caustic remarks about his frequent calls at the McIntyre house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one turn,&rdquo; she said, as the foreigner bowed and withdrew. &ldquo;I am
      feeling a little weary to-night&mdash;the strain of the inquest,&rdquo; she,
      added in explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would rather sit out the dance,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;There is an
      alcove in that window; oh, pshaw!&rdquo; as a man and a girl took possession of
      the chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, we can roost on the stairs,&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster preceded him to
      the staircase leading to the third floor, and sat down, bracing her back
      very comfortably against the railing, while Kent seated himself at her
      feet on the lower step. &ldquo;Extraordinary developments at the inquest this
      afternoon,&rdquo; he began, as she volunteered no remark. &ldquo;To think of Jimmie
      Turnbull being poisoned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unbelievable,&rdquo; she said, and her vehemence was a surprise to Kent;
      he knew her as all froth and bubble. What had brought the dark circles
      under her eyes and the unwonted seriousness in her manner?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unbelievable, yes,&rdquo; he agreed gravely. &ldquo;But true; the autopsy ended all
      doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean it developed doubt,&rdquo; she corrected, and a sigh accompanied the
      words. &ldquo;Have the police any clew to the guilty man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, I'm sure,&rdquo; Kent spoke with caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't?&rdquo; Her voice was a little sharp. &ldquo;Didn't Detective Ferguson give
      you any news when talking to you on the porch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you recognized the detective?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? No; I have never seen him before&rdquo;&mdash;she nodded gayly to an
      acquaintance passing through the hall. &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre told me his name.
      It was so odd to meet a man here not in evening clothes that I had to ask
      who he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferguson came to bring me some papers about a personal matter,&rdquo; explained
      Kent. He turned so as to face her. &ldquo;Did you see a white envelope lying on
      the table when you walked out on the porch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bowed her head absently, her foot keeping time to the inspiring music
      played by the orchestra stationed on the stair landing just above where
      they sat. &ldquo;You left it lying on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I did,&rdquo; replied Kent. &ldquo;And I believe I was so ungallant as to
      bolt into the dining room in front of you. Please accept my apologies.&rdquo;
       Behind her fan, which she used with languid grace, the widow watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all bolted together,&rdquo; she responded, &ldquo;and are equally guilty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; questioned a voice from the background, and looking up Kent saw
      Colonel McIntyre standing on the step above Mrs. Brewster. The music had
      ceased and in the lull their conversation had been distinctly audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty of curiosity,&rdquo; finished the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel de Geofroy's farewell speech was very amusing, did you not think
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not stay to hear it,&rdquo; Kent confessed. &ldquo;I had to return to the porch
      and get my envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were a long time about it,&rdquo; commented McIntyre, sitting down by Mrs.
      Brewster and possessing himself of her fan. &ldquo;I waited to tell you that
      Helen and Barbara were worn out after the inquest and so stayed at home
      to-night, but you didn't show up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did the envelope,&rdquo; retorted Kent, and as his companions looked at
      him, he added. &ldquo;It had disappeared off the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably blew away,&rdquo; suggested McIntyre. &ldquo;I noticed a strong current of
      air from the dining room, and two of the windows inclosing the porch were
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's hardly possible,&rdquo; Kent replied skeptically. &ldquo;The envelope weighed
      at least two ounces; it would have taken quite a gale to budge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre turned red. &ldquo;Are you insinuating that one of us walked off with
      your envelope, Kent?&rdquo; he demanded angrily. Mrs. Brewster stayed him as he
      was about to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not say that Detective Ferguson brought you the envelope, Mr.
      Kent?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what more likely than that he carried it off again?&rdquo; She smiled
      amusedly as Kent's expression altered. &ldquo;Why not ask the detective?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her suggestion held a grain of truth. Suppose Ferguson had not believed
      his statement that the papers in the envelope were his personal property
      and had taken the envelope away to examine it at his leisure? The thought
      brought Kent to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Mrs. Sherlock Holmes,&rdquo; he said jestingly, &ldquo;I'll follow your
      advice&rdquo;&mdash;There was no opportunity to say more, for several men had
      discovered the widow's perch on the stairs and came to claim their dances.
      Over their heads McIntyre watched Kent stride downstairs, then stooping
      over he picked up Mrs. Brewster's fan and sat down to patiently await her
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent's pursuit of the detective took longer than he had anticipated, and
      it was after midnight before he finally located him at the office of the
      Chief of Detectives in the District Building. &ldquo;I've called for the
      envelope you took from my safe early this evening,&rdquo; he began without
      preface, hardly waiting for the latter's surprised greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Kent, I left it lying on the porch table at the club,&rdquo; declared
      Ferguson. &ldquo;Didn't you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Kent's worried expression returned. &ldquo;Like a fool I forgot the
      envelope when that cheering broke out in the dining room and rushed to
      find out what it was about; when I returned to the porch the envelope was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappeared?&rdquo; questioned Ferguson in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disappeared absolutely; I searched the porch thoroughly and couldn't find
      a trace of it,&rdquo; Kent explained. &ldquo;And in spite of McIntyre's contention
      that it might have blown out of the window, I am certain it did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The windows were open, and I recollect there was a strong draught,&rdquo;
       remarked Ferguson thoughtfully. &ldquo;But not sufficient to carry away that
      envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; Kent stepped closer. &ldquo;Did you observe which one of our
      companions stood nearest the porch table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson eyed him curiously. &ldquo;Say, are you insinuating that one of those
      people took your envelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A subdued whistle escaped Ferguson. &ldquo;What was in that envelope. Mr. Kent,&rdquo;
       he demanded, &ldquo;to make it of any value to that bunch?&rdquo; and as Kent did not
      answer immediately, he added, &ldquo;Are you sure it had nothing to do with
      Jimmie Turnbull's death and Philip Rochester's disappearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo; Kent's gaze did not waver before his penetrating look. &ldquo;I
      have already told you that the envelope contained old love letters, and I
      very naturally do not wish them to fall into the hands of Colonel
      McIntyre, the father of the girl I hope to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson smiled understandingly. &ldquo;I see. From what I know of Colonel
      McIntyre there's a very narrow, nagging spirit concealed under his frank
      and engaging manner; I wish you joy of your future father-in-law,&rdquo; and he
      chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; dryly. &ldquo;You haven't answered my question as to who stood nearest
      the porch table, Ferguson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective looked thoughtful. &ldquo;We all stood fairly near; perhaps Mrs.
      Brewster was a shade the nearest. Mr. Clymer was offering her a chair when
      that noise came from the dining room. There's one thing I am willing to
      swear to&rdquo;&mdash;his manner grew more earnest&mdash;&ldquo;that envelope was
      still lying on the table when I hustled into the dining room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who was the last person to leave the porch?&rdquo; Kent demanded eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; was the disappointing answer. &ldquo;I reached the door at the
      same moment you did and passed right around the dining room to get a view
      of what was going on. I thought I would take a squint at the tables and
      see if there was any wine being used,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But there was nothing
      doing in that line. Then Mr. Clymer offered to bring me down to
      Headquarters, and I left the club with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent took a turn about the room. &ldquo;Did Mr. Clymer go to the Cosmos Club?&rdquo;
       he asked, pausing by the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I heard him tell his chauffeur to drive to the Saratoga. Want to use
      the telephone?&rdquo; observing Kent's glance stray to the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of answer Kent took off the receiver and after giving a number to
      Central, he recognized Clymer's voice over the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Mr. Clymer? Yes, well, this is Kent speaking. Can you tell me
      who was the last person to leave the porch when Colonel de Geofroy made
      his farewell speech to-night at the club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; came Clymer's surprised answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited for McIntyre to pick up Mrs. Brewster's fan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he take my letter off the table also?&rdquo; called Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo; Clymer's voice testified to his increased surprise. &ldquo;Mrs.
      Brewster dropped her fan right in the doorway just as McIntyre and I
      approached; we both stooped to get it and, like fools; bumped our heads
      together in the act. He got the fan, however, and I waited for him to walk
      into the dining room before following Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you passed the table, Mr. Clymer, did you see my letter lying on the
      table?&rdquo; persisted Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word I never looked at the table,&rdquo; Clymer's hearty tone carried
      conviction. &ldquo;I walked right along in my hurry to know what the cheering
      was about. I am sorry, Kent; have you mislaid your letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; glumly. &ldquo;Sorry to have disturbed you, Mr. Clymer; good night,&rdquo; and
      Clymer's echoing, &ldquo;Good night&rdquo; sounded faintly as he hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drew blank,&rdquo; he announced, turning to Ferguson. &ldquo;Confound you, Ferguson;
      you had no right to touch the papers in my safe. If harm comes from it,
      I'll make you suffer,&rdquo; and not waiting for the detective's jumbled
      apologies and explanations, he hurried from the building. But once on the
      sidewalk he paused for thought. McIntyre must have picked up the white
      envelope, there was no other feasible explanation of its disappearance.
      But what had attracted his attention to the envelope&mdash;the red seal
      with the big letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; was its only identifying mark. If Helen had only
      told him the contents of the envelope!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent struck his clenched fist in his left hand in wrath; something must be
      done, he could not stand there all night. Although it was through no fault
      of his own that he had lost the envelope entrusted to his care, he was
      still responsible to Helen for its disappearance. She must be told that it
      was gone, however unpleasant the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent walked hastily along Pennsylvania Avenue until he came to a drug
      store still open, and entered the telephone booth. He had recollected that
      the twins had a branch telephone in their sitting room; he would have to
      chance their being awake at that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbara McIntyre turned on her pillow and rubbed her sleepy eyes; surely
      she had been mistaken in thinking she heard the telephone bell ringing.
      Even as she lay striving to listen, she dozed off again, to be rudely
      awakened by Helen's voice at her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babs!&rdquo; came the agitated whisper. &ldquo;The envelope's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Barbara swung out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father has it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Downstairs in the library Mrs. Brewster paused on her entrance by the side
      of a piece of carved Venetian furniture and laying her coronation scarf on
      it, she examined a white envelope&mdash;the red seal was intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of approaching footsteps she raised a trap door in the piece
      of furniture and only her keen ears caught the faint thud of the envelope
      as it dropped inside, then with a happy, tender smile she turned to meet
      Colonel McIntyre.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE ECHO OF A LAUGH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre tramped the deserted dining room in exasperation. Nine
      o'clock and the twins had not come to breakfast, nor was there any
      evidence that Mrs. Brewster intended taking that meal downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you wait any longer, sir?&rdquo; inquired Grimes, who hovered solicitously
      in the background. &ldquo;I'm afraid, sir, your eggs will be over-done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring them along,&rdquo; directed McIntyre, and flung himself into his chair at
      the foot of the table. He had been seated but a few minutes when Barbara
      appeared and dutifully presented her cheek to be kissed, then she tripped
      lightly to Helen's place opposite her father, and pressed the electric
      bell for Grimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coffee, please,&rdquo; she said as that worthy appeared, and busied herself in
      arranging the cups and saucers. &ldquo;Helen is taking her breakfast upstairs,&rdquo;
       she explained to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about Mrs. Brewster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still asleep.&rdquo; Barbara poured out her father's coffee with careful
      attention to detail. &ldquo;I peeked into her room a moment ago and she looked
      so 'comfy' I hadn't the heart to awaken her. You must have been very late
      at the club last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got home a little after one o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre helped himself to poached eggs and bacon. &ldquo;What did you do last
      night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went to bed early,&rdquo; answered Barbara with brevity. &ldquo;Helen wasn't feeling
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre's handsome face showed concern as he glanced across the table.
      &ldquo;Have you sent for Dr. Stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen&mdash;I&mdash;we&rdquo;&mdash;Barbara stumbled in her speech. &ldquo;We have
      taken an aversion to Dr. Stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre set down his coffee cup with unwonted force, thereby spilling
      some of its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed in complete astonishment, and regarded her fixedly
      for a moment. His tolerant manner, which he frequently assumed toward
      Barbara, grew stern. &ldquo;Dr. Stone is my personal friend, as well as our
      family physician&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a cousin of Margaret Brewster,&rdquo; put in Barbara mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; trenchantly, aware that he had colored at mention of
      the widow's name. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Barbara's eyes opened innocently. &ldquo;I only
      recalled the fact of his relationship as you enumerated his virtues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre transferred his regard from her to the butler. &ldquo;You need
      not wait, Grimes.&rdquo; He remained silent until the servant was safely in the
      pantry, and then addressed his daughter. &ldquo;None of your tricks, Barbara,&rdquo;
       he cautioned. &ldquo;If Helen is ill enough to require medical attention, Dr.
      Stone is to be sent for, regardless of your sudden dislike to him, for
      which, by the way, you have given no cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I?&rdquo; Barbara folded her napkin with neat exactness. &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's
      intangible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; McIntyre gave a short laugh, as he pushed back his chair. &ldquo;I'm
      going to see Helen. And Barbara,&rdquo; stopping on his way to the door, &ldquo;don't
      be a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara rubbed the tiny mole under the lobe of her ear, a trick she had
      when absent-minded or in deep thought. &ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; she announced, unaware
      that she spoke loud, &ldquo;shall have a physician, but it won't be&mdash;why,
      Grimes,&rdquo; awakening to the servant's noiseless return. &ldquo;You can take the
      breakfast dishes. Did Miss Helen eat anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much, miss.&rdquo; Grimes shook a troubled head. &ldquo;But she done better
      than at dinner last night, so she's picking up, and don't you be worried
      over her,&rdquo; with emphasis, as he sidled nearer. &ldquo;Tell me, miss, is the
      colonel courtin' Mrs. Brewster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him,&rdquo; she suggested and smiled at the consternation which spread over
      the butler's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, miss!&rdquo; he exclaimed in horror. &ldquo;It would be as much as my place is
      worth; the colonel's that quick-tempered. Why, miss, just because I tidied
      up his desk and put his papers to rights he flew into a terrible passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early this morning, miss; and he so upset Thomas, miss, that he gave
      notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's too bad.&rdquo; Barbara liked the second man. &ldquo;Perhaps father will
      reconsider and persuade him to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler looked unconvinced. &ldquo;It was about the police dogs,&rdquo; he confided
      to her. &ldquo;Thomas told him that Miss Helen wanted them brought back, and the
      colonel swore at him&mdash;'twas more than Thomas could stand and he ups
      and goes.&rdquo; Barbara halted half way to the door. &ldquo;Did Thomas get the dogs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait and see, miss.&rdquo; Grimes was guilty of a most undignified wink.
      &ldquo;Thomas ain't forgiven himself for not being here Monday night, miss;
      though it wouldn't a done him any good; he wouldn't a heard Mr. Turnbull
      climbing in or his arrest, away upstairs in the servants' quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grimes,&rdquo; Barbara retracted her footsteps and placed her lips very close
      to the old servant's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came in on Tuesday morning I found the door to the attic stairway
      standing partly open...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you now, miss?&rdquo; The two regarded each other warily. &ldquo;And what hour
      may that have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler cocked his ear for her answer&mdash;'he was sometimes a little
      hard of hearing; but he waited in vain, Barbara had disappeared inside the
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre had not gone at once to see his daughter Helen, as
      Barbara had supposed from his remark, instead he went down the staircase
      and into the reception room on the ground floor. It was generally used as
      a smoking room and lounge, but when entertaining was done, cloaks and
      wraps were left there. McIntyre looked over the prettily upholstered
      furniture, then strolled to the window and carefully inspected the lock;
      it appeared in perfect order as he tested it. Pushing the catch back as
      far as it would go, he raised the window&mdash;the sash moved upward
      without a sound, and he leaned out and looked up and down the path which
      ran the depth of the house to the kitchen door and servants' entrance.
      There was an iron gate separating the path from the sidewalk, always kept
      locked at night, and McIntyre had thought that sufficient protection and
      had not put an iron grille in the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre closed and locked the window, then pulling out the gilt chair
      which stood in front of the desk, he sat down, selected some monogrammed
      paper and penned a few lines in his characteristic though legible writing.
      Picking up some red sealing wax, he lighted the small candle in its brass
      holder which matched the rest of the desk ornaments, but before heating
      the wax he looked for his signet ring, and frowned when he recalled
      leaving it on his dresser. He hesitated a moment, then catching sight of a
      silver seal lying at the back of the desk he picked it up and moistened
      the initial. A few minutes later he blew out the candle, returned the wax
      and seal to a pigeon hole, and carefully placed the envelope with its well
      stamped letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; in his coat pocket, and tramped upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen heard his heavy tread coming down the hall toward her room, and
      scrambled back to bed. She had but time to arrange her dressing sacque
      when her father walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, my dear,&rdquo; he said and, stooping over, kissed her. As he
      straightened up, the side of his single-breasted coat turned back and
      exposed to Helen's bright eyes the end of a white envelope. &ldquo;Barbara told
      me you are not well,&rdquo; he wheeled forward a chair and sat down by the bed.
      &ldquo;Hadn't I better send for Dr. Stone?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; her reply, though somewhat
      faint, was emphatic, and he frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; aggressively. &ldquo;I trust you do not share Barbara's suddenly
      developed prejudice against the good doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not require a physician,&rdquo; she said evasively. &ldquo;I am well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre regarded her vexedly. He could not decide whether her flushed
      cheeks were from fever or the result of exertion or excitement. Excitement
      over what? He looked about the room; it reflected the taste of its dainty
      owner in its furnishings, but nowhere did he find an answer to his
      unspoken question, until his eye lighted on a box of rouge under the
      electric lamp on her bed stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't use that,&rdquo; he said, touching the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I detest make-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; She turned to see what he was talking about. &ldquo;That rouge
      belongs to Margaret Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre promptly changed the conversation. &ldquo;Have you had your breakfast?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Grimes took the tray down some time ago.&rdquo; Helen watched her father
      fidget with his watch fob for several minutes, then asked with
      characteristic directness. &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see that you have proper medical attention if you are ill,&rdquo; he
      returned promptly. &ldquo;How would a week or ten days at Atlantic City suit you
      and Barbara?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; Helen sat up from her reclining position on the pillows.
      &ldquo;You forget, father, that we have a house-guest; Margaret Brewster is not
      leaving until May.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had not forgotten,&rdquo; curtly. &ldquo;I propose that she go with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; escaped Helen, otherwise she made no comment, and McIntyre,
      after contemplating her for a minute, looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either go to Atlantic City with us, Helen, or resume your normal,
      everyday life,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;I am tired of heroics; Jimmie Turnbull
      was hardly the man to inspire them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Helen's voice rang out imperiously. &ldquo;I will not permit one word
      said in disparagement of Jimmie, least of all from you, father. Wait,&rdquo; as
      he attempted to speak. &ldquo;I do not know what traits of character I may have
      inherited from you, but I have all mother's loyalty, and&mdash;that
      loyalty belongs to Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre's eyes shifted under her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret very much this obsession,&rdquo; he said rising. &ldquo;I will not attempt
      to reason with you again, Helen, but&rdquo;&mdash;he made no effort to lower his
      voice, &ldquo;the world&mdash;our world will soon know what manner of man James
      Turnbull was, of that I am determined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rdquo;&mdash;Helen faced her father proudly&mdash;&ldquo;I will leave no stone
      unturned to defend his memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father wheeled about. &ldquo;In doing so, see that you do not compromise
      yourself,&rdquo; he remarked coldly, and before the infuriated girl could
      answer, he slammed the door shut and stalked downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some half hour later he opened the door of Rochester and Kent's law office
      and would have walked unceremoniously into Kent's private office had not
      John Sylvester stepped forward from behind his desk in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Colonel,&rdquo; he said civilly. &ldquo;Mr. Kent is not here. Do you
      wish to leave any message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good morning, Sylvester,&rdquo; McIntyre's manner was brusque. &ldquo;When do you
      expect Mr. Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In about twenty minutes, Colonel.&rdquo; Sylvester glanced at the wall clock.
      &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre took the chair and planted it by the window. Never a very patient
      man, he waited for Kent with increasing irritation, and at the end of half
      an hour his temper was uppermost. &ldquo;Give me something to write with,&rdquo; he
      demanded of Sylvester. Accepting the clerk's fountain pen without thanks,
      he walked over to the center table and, drawing out his leather wallet,
      took from it a visiting card and, stooping over, wrote:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        You have but thirty-six hours remaining.
                                             McIntyre.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that Mr. Kent gets this card,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;No, don't put it there,&rdquo;
       irascibly, as the clerk laid the card on top of a pile of letters. &ldquo;Take
      it into Mr. Kent's office and put it on his desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was that about Colonel McIntyre which inspired complete obedience to
      his wishes, and Sylvester followed his directions without further
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clerk stepped into Kent's office McIntyre saw a woman sitting by
      the empty desk. She turned her head on hearing footsteps and their glances
      met. A faint exclamation broke from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; McIntyre strode past Sylvester. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster's ready laugh hid all sign of embarrassment. &ldquo;Must you
      know?&rdquo; she asked archly. &ldquo;That is hardly fair to Barbara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Barbara sent you here with a message!&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster treated his
      remark as a statement and not a question, and briskly changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't wait any longer,&rdquo; she pouted. &ldquo;Please tell Mr. Kent that I am
      sorry not to have seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, madam.&rdquo; Sylvester placed McIntyre's card in the center of Kent's
      desk and flew to open the door for Mrs. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the widow stepped into the corridor she brushed by an over-dressed
      woman, whose cheap finery gave clear indication of her tastes. Hardly
      noticing another's presence she turned and took McIntyre's arm and they
      strolled off together, her soft laugh floating back to where Mrs.
      Sylvester stood talking to her husband.

      CHAPTER XIII. THE FACE AT THE WINDOW
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harry Kent rang the doorbell at the McIntyre residence for the fifth time,
      and wondered what had become of the faithful Grimes; the butler was
      usually the soul of promptness, and to keep a caller waiting on the
      doorstep would, in his category, rank as the height of impropriety. As
      Kent again raised his hand toward the bell, the door swung open suddenly
      and Barbara beckoned to him to come inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bell is out of order,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I saw you from the window.
      Hurry, and Grimes won't know that you are here,&rdquo; and she darted ahead of
      him into the reception room. Kent followed more slowly; he was hurt that
      she had had no other greeting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babs, aren't you glad to see me?&rdquo; he asked wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant her eyes were lighted by her old sunny smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am,&rdquo; she whispered softly. As his arms closed around her and
      their lips met in a tender kiss she added fervently, &ldquo;Oh, Harry, why
      didn't you make me marry you in the happy bygone days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you often enough,&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go with me to Rockville at once?&rdquo; Her face changed and she drew
      back from him. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is selfish of me to think of my own
      happiness now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about mine?&rdquo; demanded Kent with warmth. &ldquo;If you won't consider
      yourself, consider me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo; She looked out of the window to conceal sudden blinding tears.
      There was a hint of hidden tragedy in her lovely face which went to Kent's
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; his voice was very tender, &ldquo;is there nothing I can do for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she shook her head drearily. &ldquo;This family must 'dree its
      weir.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent studied her in silence; that she was in deadly earnest he recognized,
      she was no hysterical fool or given to sentimental twaddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to me on Wednesday to ask my aid in solving Jimmie Turnbull's
      death,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have learned certain facts&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she cautioned. &ldquo;Let me close the door.
      Now, go on&mdash;&rdquo; with her customary impetuosity she reseated herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I do so, I must tell you, Babs, that I recognized the fraud you
      and Helen perpetrated at the coroner's inquest yesterday afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fraud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quietly. &ldquo;I am aware that you impersonated Helen on the witness
      stand and vice versa. You took a frightful risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;In my testimony I told nothing but the
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never doubted you told the truth regarding the events of Monday night
      as you saw them, but the coroner's questions were put to you under the
      impression that you were Helen.&rdquo; Kent scrutinized her keenly. &ldquo;Would Helen
      have been able to give the same answers that you did without perjuring
      herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara started and her face paled. &ldquo;Are you insinuating that Helen killed
      Jimmie?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; his emphatic denial was prompt. &ldquo;But I do believe that she knows
      more of what transpired Monday night than she is willing to admit. Is that
      not so, Barbara?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she acknowledged reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know who poisoned Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; Barbara rested a firm hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;I swear Helen
      does not know. You must believe me, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may not know,&rdquo; Kent spoke slowly. &ldquo;But are you sure she does not
      suspect some one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what if I do?&rdquo; asked Helen quietly, and Kent, looking around, found
      her standing just inside the door. Her entrance had been noiseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should tell the authorities, Helen.&rdquo; Kent rose as she passed him and
      selected a seat which brought her face somewhat in shadow. &ldquo;If you do not
      you may retard justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I speak I may involve the innocent,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; her
      eyes shifted from him to Barbara and back again. &ldquo;I cannot undertake that
      responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better that than let the guilty escape through your silence,&rdquo; protested
      Kent. &ldquo;Possibly the theories of the police may coincide with yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; asked Barbara impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent considered before replying. If Detective Ferguson had gone so far as
      to secure a search warrant to go through Rochester's apartment and office
      it would not be long before the fact of his being a &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; would be
      common property; there could, therefore, be no harm in his repeating
      Ferguson's conversation to the twins. In fact, as their legal
      representative, they were entitled to know the latest developments from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detective Ferguson believes that the poison was administered by Philip
      Rochester,&rdquo; he said finally, and watched to see how the announcement would
      affect them. Barbara's eyes opened to their widest extent, and back in her
      corner, into which she had gradually edged her chair, Helen emitted a
      long, long breath as her taut muscles relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes Ferguson think Philip guilty?&rdquo; demanded Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is known that he and Jimmie were not on good terms,&rdquo; replied Kent.
      &ldquo;Then Rochester's disappearance after Jimmie's death lends color to the
      theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Philip really disappeared?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;You showed me a telegram&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apparently the telegram was a fake,&rdquo; admitted Kent. &ldquo;The Cleveland police
      report that he is not at the address given in the telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who could have an object in sending such a telegram?&rdquo; asked Barbara
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rochester, in the hope of throwing the police off his track, if he really
      killed Jimmie.&rdquo; Kent looked straight at Helen. &ldquo;It was while searching our
      office safe for trace of Rochester's present address that Ferguson
      obtained possession of your sealed envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen plucked nervously at the ribbon on her gown. &ldquo;Did the detective open
      the envelope&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positive; the red seal was unbroken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us how the envelope came to be stolen from you,&rdquo; coaxed Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were in the little smoking porch off the dining room at the Club de
      Vingt.&rdquo; Barbara smiled her remembrance of it, and motioned Kent to
      continue. &ldquo;Ferguson had just put down the envelope on the table and I
      started to pick it up when cheering in the dining room distracted my
      attention and I, with the others, went to see what it was about. When I
      returned to the porch the envelope was no longer on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were with you?&rdquo; questioned Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father, Mrs. Brewster&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; murmured Barbara. &ldquo;Go on, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detective Ferguson and Ben Glymer,&rdquo; Barbara made a wry face, &ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;went
      on Kent, not heeding her, &ldquo;each of these persons deny any further
      knowledge of the envelope, except they declare it was lying on the table
      when we all made a dash for the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the last to leave the porch?&rdquo; asked Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Clymer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he saw no one take the envelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He declares that he had his back to the table, part of the time, but to
      the best of his knowledge no one took the envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them must have,&rdquo; insisted Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The envelope hadn't legs or wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them did take it,&rdquo; agreed Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But which one is the question. Frankly, to find the answer, I must know
      the contents of the envelope, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because then I will have some idea who would be enough interested in the
      envelope to steal it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen considered him long and thoughtfully. &ldquo;I cannot answer your
      question,&rdquo; she announced finally. She saw his face harden, and hastened to
      explain. &ldquo;Not through any lack of confidence in you, Harry, b-b-but,&rdquo; she
      stumbled in her speech. &ldquo;I&mdash;I do not know what the envelope
      contains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared at her open-mouthed. &ldquo;Then who requested you to lock the
      envelope in Rochester's safe?&rdquo; he demanded, and receiving no reply, asked
      suddenly: &ldquo;Was it Rochester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at liberty to tell you,&rdquo; she responded; her mouth set in
      obstinate lines and before he could press his request a second time, she
      asked: &ldquo;Philip Rochester defended Jimmie in court when every one thought
      him a burglar; why then, should Philip have picked him out to attack&mdash;he
      is not a homicidal maniac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but the police contend that Rochester recognized Jimmie in his
      make-up and decided to kill him; hoping his death would be attributed to
      angina pectoris, and no post-mortem held,&rdquo; wound up Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don t quite understand&rdquo;&mdash;Helen raised her handkerchief to her
      forehead and removed a drop of moisture. &ldquo;How did Philip kill Jimmie there
      in court before us all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ferguson believes that he put the dose of aconitine in the glass of water
      which Jimmie asked for,&rdquo; explained Kent, and would have continued his
      remarks, but a scream from Barbara startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, look at the window,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I saw a face peering in. Look
      quick, Harry, look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent needed no second bidding, but although he craned his head far outside
      the open window and gazed both up and down the street and along the path
      to the kitchen door, he failed to see any one. &ldquo;Was it a man or woman?&rdquo; he
      asked, turning back to the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn't tell; it was just a glimpse.&rdquo; Barbara stood resting
      one hand on the table, her weight leaning upon it. Not for words would she
      have had Kent know that her knees were shaking under her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the face, Helen?&rdquo; As he put the question Kent looked around
      at the silent girl in the corner; she had slipped back in her chair and,
      with closed eyes, lay white-lipped and limp. With a leap Kent gained her
      side and his hand sought her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring for brandy and water,&rdquo; he directed as Barbara came to his aid.
      &ldquo;Helen has fainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twenty minutes later Kent hastened out of the McIntyre house and, turning
      into Connecticut Avenue, boarded a street car headed south. After carrying
      Helen to the twins' sitting room he had assisted Barbara in reviving her.
      He had wondered at the time why Barbara had not summoned the servants,
      then concluded that neither sister wished a scene. That Helen was worse
      than she would admit he appreciated, and advised Barbara to send for Dr.
      Stone. The well-meant suggestion had apparently fallen on deaf ears, for
      no physician had appeared during the time he was in the house, nor had
      Barbara used the telephone, almost at her elbow as she sat by her sister's
      couch, to summon Dr. Stone. Kent had only waited long enough to convince
      himself that Helen was out of danger, and then had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly one o'clock when he finally stepped inside his office, and
      he found his clerk and a dressy female bending eagerly over a newspaper.
      They looked up at his approach and Sylvester came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my wife, sir,&rdquo; he explained, and Kent bowed courteously to Mrs.
      Sylvester. &ldquo;We were just reading this account of Mr. Rochester's
      disappearance; it's dreadful, sir, to think that the police believe him
      guilty of Mr. Turnbull's murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Kent; the news had been published even sooner
      than he had imagined. &ldquo;What paper is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The noon edition of the Times.&rdquo; Sylvester handed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Kent flung down his hat and spread open the paper. &ldquo;Who have
      been here to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre, sir; he left a card for you.&rdquo; Sylvester hurried into
      Kent's office, to return a moment later with a visiting card. &ldquo;He left
      this, sir, for you with most particular directions that it be handed to
      you at once on your arrival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent read the curt message on the card without comment and tore the
      paste-board into tiny bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one else been in this morning?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Sylvester consulted a written memorandum. &ldquo;Mr. Black called,
      also Colonel Thorne, Senator Harris, and Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster!&rdquo; The newspaper slipped from Kent's fingers in his
      astonishment. &ldquo;What did she want here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see you, sir, so she said, but she first asked for Mr. Rochester,&rdquo;
       explained Sylvester, stooping over to pick up the inside sheet of the
      Times which had separated from the others. &ldquo;I told her that Mr. Rochester
      was unavoidably detained in Cleveland; then she said she would consult you
      and I let her wait in your office for the good part of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent thought a moment then walked toward his door; on its threshold he
      paused, struck by a sudden idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Colonel McIntyre come with Mrs. Brewster?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Kent; he came in while she was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they went off together,&rdquo; volunteered Mrs. Sylvester, who had been a
      silent listener to their conversation. Kent started; he had forgotten the
      woman. &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; she continued, and stepped toward him. &ldquo;I
      presume, likely, that you are very interested in this charge of murder
      against your partner, Mr. Rochester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; affirmed Kent, as Mrs. Sylvester paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am too, sir,&rdquo; she confided to him. &ldquo;Cause you see I was in the court
      room when Mr. Turnbull died and I'm naturally interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; agreed Kent with a commiserating glance at his clerk; the
      latter's wife threatened to be loquacious, and he judged from her looks
      that it was a habit which had grown with the years. As a general rule he
      abhorred talkative women, but&mdash;&ldquo;And what took you to the police court
      on Tuesday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, me and Mr. Sylvester have our little differences like other married
      couples,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;And sometimes we ask the Court to settle them.&rdquo;
       She caught Kent's look of impatience and hurried her speech. &ldquo;The burglar
      case came on just after ours was remanded, and seeing the McIntyre twins,
      whom I've often read about, I just thought I'd stay. Let me have that
      paper a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Kent gave her the newspaper and she ran her finger down the
      columns devoted to the Turnbull case with a slowness that set his already
      excited nerves on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's what I'm looking for,&rdquo; she exclaimed triumphantly, a minute later,
      and pointed to the paragraph:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Mrs.  Margaret Perry Brewster, the fascinating widow, added
   nothing material to the case in her testimony, and she was
   quickly excused, after stating that she was told about the
   tragedy by the McIntyre twins upon their return from the
   Police Court.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well what of it?&rdquo; asked Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this, Mr. Kent;&rdquo; Mrs. Sylvester enjoyed nothing so much as talking
      to a good looking man, especially in the presence of her husband, and she
      could not refrain from a triumphant look at him as she went on with her
      remarks. &ldquo;There was a female sitting on the bench next to me in Court; in
      fact, she and I were the only women on that side, and I kinder noticed her
      on that account, and then I saw she was all done up in veils&mdash;I
      couldn't see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I caught her peering this way and that during the burglar's hearing; I
      don't reckon she could see well through all the veils. Now, don't get
      impatient, Mr. Kent; I'm getting to my point&mdash;that woman sitting next
      to me in the police court was the widow Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Kent laughed unbelievingly. &ldquo;Oh, come, you are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not, sir.&rdquo; Mrs. Sylvester spoke with conviction. &ldquo;Now, why does Mrs.
      Brewster declare at the coroner's inquest that she only heard of the
      Turnbull tragedy from the McIntyre twins on their return home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be mistaken,&rdquo; argued Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you admit yourself that the woman was so swathed in veils that you
      could not see her face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I heard her laugh in court,&rdquo; Mrs. Sylvester spoke in deep
      earnestness and Kent placed faith in her statement in spite of his outward
      skepticism. &ldquo;And I heard her laugh in this corridor this morning and I
      placed her as the same woman. I asked Mr. Sylvester who she was, and he
      told me. I'd been reading this account of the Turnbull inquest, and I
      recollected seeing Mrs. Brewster's name, and my husband and I were just
      reading the account over when you came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent gazed in perplexity at Mrs. Sylvester. &ldquo;Why did Mrs. Brewster laugh
      in the police court?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Dr. Stone exclaimed to the deputy marshal&mdash;'Your prisoner
      appears ill!'&rdquo; declared Mrs. Sylvester; she enjoyed the dramatic, and that
      Kent was hanging on her words she was fully aware, in spite of his
      expressionless face. &ldquo;Dr. Stone lifted the burglar in his arms and then
      Mrs. Brewster laughed as she laughed in the corridor to-day&mdash;a soft
      gurgling laugh.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. PAY CASH
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the rush hour at the Metropolis Trust Company and the busy paying
      teller counted out silver and gold and treasury notes of varying
      denominations with the mechanical precision and exactness which experience
      gives. Suddenly his hand stopped midway toward the money drawer, his
      attention arrested by the signature on a check. A swift glance upward
      showed him a girl's face at the grille of the window. There was an
      instant's pause, then she addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do hurry, Mr. McDonald; father is waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Miss McIntyre.&rdquo; He stamped the check and laid it to one side,
      &ldquo;how do you want the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot.&rdquo; She glanced at a memorandum on the back of an envelope.
      &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster wishes ten tens, five twenties, and ten ones. Thank you,
      good afternoon,&rdquo; and counting over the money she thrust it inside her bag
      and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been gone a bare five minutes when Kent reached the window and
      pushed several checks toward the teller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Clymer in his office, McDonald?&rdquo; he asked, placing the bank notes
      given, him in his wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure.&rdquo; The teller glanced around at the clock; the hands stood at
      ten minutes of three. &ldquo;It's pretty near closing time, Kent; still, he may
      be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go and see,&rdquo; and with a nod of farewell Kent turned on his heel and
      walked off in the direction of the office of the bank president. On
      reaching there he saw, through the glass partition of the door, Clymer
      seated in earnest conclave with two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happening to glance up Clymer recognized Kent and beckoned to him to come
      inside. &ldquo;You know Taylor,&rdquo; he said by way of introduction. &ldquo;And this is
      Mr. Harding of New York&mdash;Mr. Kent,&rdquo; he turned around in his swivel
      chair to face the three men. &ldquo;Draw up a chair, Kent; we were just going
      over to see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Kent looked inquiringly at the bank president, the gravity of his
      manner betokened serious tidings. &ldquo;What is it, Mr. Clymer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer did not reply at once. &ldquo;It's this,&rdquo; he said finally, with blunt
      directness. &ldquo;Your partner, Philip Rochester, appears to be a bankrupt.
      Harding and Taylor came in here to attach his private bank account to
      cover indebtedness to their business firms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation broke from Kent. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have said the same this morning,&rdquo; declared Clymer. &ldquo;But on
      investigation I find that Rochester has over-drawn his account here for a
      large amount and borrowed heavily. The further I look into his financial
      affairs the more involved I find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;Kent was white-lipped. &ldquo;I know for an absolute fact that
      Rochester was paid some exceedingly large fees last week, totaling over
      fifty thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never deposited such a sum, or anywhere like that amount in this
      bank either last week or this,&rdquo; stated Clymer, running his eyes down a
      bank statement which, with several pass books, lay on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he carry accounts at other banks?&rdquo; inquired Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I can discover,&rdquo; responded Taylor. &ldquo;I have been to every
      national and private banking house in Washington, but all deny having him
      as a depositor. Did Rochester ever bank out of town, Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo; Kent drew out a bank book. &ldquo;Here is the firm's
      balance, Mr. Clymer; we bank here, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Clymer's look of anxiety deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see McDonald as you came in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he cashed some checks for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your personal checks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kent looked questioningly at Clymer. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this; that all moneys deposited here in the firm name of Rochester
      and Kent have been drawn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not possible!&rdquo; Kent started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Checks on that account must bear both Rochester's signature and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Checks bearing both signatures have been presented for the total sum
      deposited to your credit,&rdquo; stated Clymer and he picked up four canceled
      checks. &ldquo;See for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared at the checks in dumbfounded silence; then carrying them to
      the light he examined them with minute care before bringing them back to
      the bank president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the first I have heard of these transactions,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the signatures are clever forgeries.&rdquo; His statement was heard with
      gravity. Taylor exchanged a meaning look with the New Yorker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean your signature is a forgery,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Rochester had a
      peculiar gift of penmanship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent sprang up. &ldquo;Do you accuse Philip Rochester of signing these checks
      and inserting my name to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; calmly. &ldquo;I am not familiar with your signature, Kent, but that
      Rochester wrote the body of those four checks and put his own signature at
      the bottom I will swear to in any court of law. To make them valid he had
      to add your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, d&mdash;mn it, man!&rdquo; Kent stared in bewilderment at his three
      companions. &ldquo;Rochester was honorable and straight-forward&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And addicted to drink,&rdquo; put in Harding. &ldquo;But not a forger,&rdquo; retorted Kent
      firmly. Harding's only rejoinder was a skeptical smile as he turned to
      address Clymer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Rochester not only has taken his own money, but withdrawn that
      belonging to the firm of Rochester and Kent without the knowledge of his
      junior partner; it looks black, Mr. Clymer,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Especially when
      taken in consideration with his other involved financial transactions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will we find Rochester, Kent?&rdquo; asked Taylor, before the bank
      president could answer the New Yorker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent paused in indecision. What reply could he make without further
      involving Rochester in trouble? He had not the faintest idea where
      Rochester was, but to state that he was missing could not but add to the
      belief that he had made away with all the money he could lay his hands on.
      The noon edition of the Times had hinted at Rochester's disappearance but
      had stated they could not get the statement confirmed from Police
      Headquarters; obviously Harding and Taylor had not seen the newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it just to the men before him to keep them in the dark? If their
      claims were true, and Kent never doubted that they were, they had already
      lost money through Rochester's extraordinary behavior. Kent turned sick at
      the thought of his own loss&mdash;his savings swept away. Would Barbara
      wait for him&mdash;was it fair to ask her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Taylor broke the prolonged silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met Detective Ferguson on my way here,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;He told me that the
      police were looking for Rochester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Harding looked up, startled. &ldquo;Why didn't you inform me of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought we'd better hear from Mr. Clymer the true state of
      Rochester's finances,&rdquo; responded Taylor. &ldquo;I never anticipated such facts
      as he has given us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you knew the police were after Rochester&mdash;&rdquo; objected Harding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clymer broke into the conversation; there was a heavy frown on his usually
      placid countenance. &ldquo;I judged from Detective Ferguson's confidences to us,
      Kent, at the Club de Vingt that he was wanted by the police in connection
      with the Turnbull tragedy, but the facts brought out through Harding's
      action to attach Rochester's bank account, puts a different construction
      on Rochester's disappearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had Rochester to do with Jimmie Turnbull?&rdquo; questioned Harding,
      before Kent could answer Clymer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They lived together,&rdquo; he replied shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And one dies and the other disappears,&rdquo; Harding whistled dolefully.
      &ldquo;Wasn't Mr. Turnbull an official of this bank, Mr. Clymer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, our cashier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were his affairs involved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Clymer spoke with emphasis. &ldquo;A most honorable fellow,
      Jimmie Turnbull; his murder was a shocking affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the police found any motive for the crime, Kent?&rdquo; asked Taylor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding, who had been ruminating in silence, leaned forward, his
      expression alight with a sudden idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could it be that Turnbull found out that Rochester was passing forged
      checks, and Rochester insured his silence by poisoning him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clymer and Kent exchanged glances, as Kent's thoughts reverted to the
      forged letter presented by Turnbull to the bank's treasurer, whereby he
      had been given McIntyre's valuable negotiable securities. Could it be that
      Rochester had written the letter, given it to his room-mate, Turnbull, and
      the latter, thinking it genuine, had secured the McIntyre securities and
      handed them over to Rochester? The idea took Kent's breath away; and yet,
      the more he contemplated it, the more feasible it appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the date on those checks?&rdquo; demanded Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuesday of this week&mdash;the day Jimmie Turnbull died.&rdquo; Clymer turned
      them over. &ldquo;They are drawn payable to cash, and bear no endorsement, which
      shows Rochester must have presented them himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding and Taylor glanced significantly at each other, but neither spoke.
      Suddenly Kent pushed back his chair and rose without ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go, Kent.&rdquo; Clymer took up some papers. &ldquo;There's a matter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will keep.&rdquo; Kent's mouth was set and determined. &ldquo;I give you my word
      of honor that all Rochester's honest debts will be paid by the firm if
      necessary; I will obligate myself to that extent,&rdquo; he paused. &ldquo;As for you
      fellows,&rdquo; turning to Harding and Taylor who had also risen. &ldquo;Give me
      twenty-four hours&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; they chorused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To locate Philip Rochester,&rdquo; and waiting for no answer Kent bolted out of
      the office.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. WHEN THE LIGHT FAILED
    </h2>
    <p>
      The city lights were springing up block after block along Pennsylvania
      Avenue as Detective Ferguson left that busy thoroughfare and hurried to
      the Saratoga. He stepped inside the lobby of the apartment house a full
      minute before his appointment with its manager, and went at once to look
      him up. Before he could carry out his purpose he was joined by Harry Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finley had to go out,&rdquo; the latter explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him I would go up to Rochester's apartment with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson thoughtfully caressed his clean-shaven jaw for a second, then
      came to a rapid decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lead the way, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll follow.&rdquo; Kent found him a silent
      companion while in the elevator and when walking down the corridor to
      Rochester's apartment, but once inside the living room, with the outer
      door tightly closed, Ferguson tossed down his hat and his whole demeanor
      changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Kent.&rdquo; He selected a chair near Rochester's desk for
      himself, as Kent found another. &ldquo;Let's thrash this thing out; are you
      working with me or against me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; Kent's surprise at the question was evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because every time I arrange to examine this apartment or inquire into
      Rochester's whereabouts you show up.&rdquo; Ferguson's small eyes were trying to
      out-stare Kent, but the latter's clear gaze did not drop before his. &ldquo;Are
      you aiding Philip Rochester in his efforts to elude arrest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; declared Kent emphatically. &ldquo;What prompts the question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact that you are Rochester's partner,&rdquo; Ferguson pointed out; his
      manner was still stiff. &ldquo;It would be only natural for you to help him
      disappear out of friendship, or&rdquo;&mdash;with a sidelong glance&mdash;&ldquo;from
      a desire to hush up a scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary I want Rochester found and every bit of evidence against
      him sifted out and aired,&rdquo; retorted Kent. &ldquo;Two heads are better than one,
      Ferguson; let us work together. Rochester must be located within the next
      twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson debated a moment, but Kent's speech as well as his manner
      indicated his sincerity, and the detective shook off his suspicions. &ldquo;Have
      you had any further news of your partner?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that is&rdquo;&mdash;recalling the scene in the bank early that afternoon&mdash;&ldquo;nothing
      that relates to Rochester's present whereabouts. Now, Ferguson, to put
      your charges against Rochester in concrete form, you believe that he was
      insanely jealous of Jimmie Turnbull, that he recognized him in the Police
      Court in his burglar disguise, slipped a dose of aconitine in a glass of
      water which Turnbull drank, and after declaring that his friend had died
      from angina pectoris, disappeared. Is that all the case you have against
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present, yes,&rdquo; admitted the detective cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All circumstantial evidence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it will hold in court&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, will it?&rdquo; questioned Kent. &ldquo;There's one big flaw in your case,
      Ferguson; the poison used to kill Turnbull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aconitine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. Your theory is that Rochester slipped the poison in the glass of
      water on recognizing Turnbull in the police court; now, it is stretching
      probability to suppose that Rochester, a strong healthy man, was carrying
      that drug around in his vest pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson sat forward in his chair, his eyes glittering. &ldquo;Do you mean to
      say that you think the murder of Turnbull was premeditated and not
      committed on the spur of the moment?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact that aconitine was used convinces me of that,&rdquo; answered Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson thought a moment. &ldquo;If that is the case,&rdquo; he said, grudgingly, &ldquo;it
      sort of squashes the charge against Philip Rochester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem to,&rdquo; agreed Kent. &ldquo;But every shred of evidence I find
      points to Rochester as the guilty man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson edged his chair forward. &ldquo;What have you discovered?&rdquo; he demanded
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; Kent spoke with increased earnestness. &ldquo;That Philip Rochester is
      apparently a bankrupt, that he has over-drawn his private account at the
      Metropolis Trust Company, and withdrawn our partnership funds from the
      same bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your partnership funds!&rdquo; echoed the detective, eyeing Kent sharply. &ldquo;How
      did you come to let him do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not aware that he had done so until Mr. Clymer told me of the
      transaction this afternoon,&rdquo; answered Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not know&rdquo;&mdash;Ferguson looked at him in dawning comprehension.
      &ldquo;You mean Rochester absconded with the funds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one forged my name to checks drawn on the firm's account,&rdquo; Kent
      continued. &ldquo;I understood they were made payable to cash and presented by
      Rochester on the day of Turnbull's death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson whistled as a slight vent to his feelings. &ldquo;So you suspect
      Rochester of being a forger?&rdquo; Kent made no reply, and he added; after a
      moment's deliberation, &ldquo;What bearing has this discovery on Turnbull's
      death, aside from Rochester's need of funds to make a clean
      disappearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is true that Rochester was financially embarrassed and forged
      checks on the Metropolis Trust Company, it establishes another motive for
      the killing of Turnbull,&rdquo; argued Kent. &ldquo;Turnbull was cashier of that
      bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see; he may have discovered the forgeries&mdash;but hold on.&rdquo; Ferguson
      checked his rapid speech. &ldquo;When were these forged checks presented at the
      bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tuesday afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson's face fell. &ldquo;Pshaw! man; that was after Turnbull's death&mdash;how
      could he detect the forgeries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent did not reply at once; instead, he glanced keenly about the living
      room. The detective had only switched on one of the reading lamps and the
      greater part was in shadow. It was a pleasant and home-like room, and Kent
      was conscious of a keener pang for the loss of Jimmie Turnbull and the
      disappearance of Philip Rochester, as he gazed around. The lawyer and the
      bank cashier had been, until that winter, congenial comrades, sharing
      their business success and their apartment in complete accord; and now a
      shadow as black as that enveloping the unlighted apartment hung over their
      good names, threatening one or the other with the charge of forgery and of
      murder. Kent sighed and turned back to the silent detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can best answer your question by telling you that the day after Jimmie
      Turnbull died Mr. Clymer sent for me,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I found Colonel McIntyre
      with him and was told that the Colonel had lost valuable securities left
      at the bank. These securities had been given by the treasurer of the bank
      to Jimmie Turnbull when he presented a letter from Colonel McIntyre
      instructing the bank to surrender the securities to Jimmie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Ferguson. &ldquo;Go on, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That letter was a forgery.&rdquo; Kent sat back and watched the detective's
      rapidly changing expression. &ldquo;And no trace has been found of the Colonel's
      securities, last known to be in the possession of Turnbull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; ejaculated Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which was the forger&mdash;Turnbull or Rochester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent shook a puzzled head. &ldquo;That is for us to discover,&rdquo; he said soberly.
      &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre contends that Turnbull forged the letter and stole the
      securities, then fearing his guilt would become known, committed still
      another crime&mdash;that of suicide, he could have swallowed a dose of
      aconitine while at the police court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be&mdash;blessed!&rdquo; ejaculated Ferguson. &ldquo;But if he was the
      forger how does that square with Rochester's peculiar behavior? The checks
      bearing your forged signatures were presented, mind you, by Rochester
      after Turnbull's death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't square,&rdquo; acknowledged Kent frankly. &ldquo;There is this to be said
      for Turnbull: he was the soul of honor, his affairs were found to be in
      excellent condition, he was drawing a good salary, his investments paying
      well&mdash;he did not need to acquire securities or money by resorting to
      forgery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas Philip Rochester was on the point of bankruptcy,&rdquo; remarked
      Ferguson. &ldquo;Do you suppose he forged Colonel McIntyre's letter and gave it
      to Turnbull, and the latter got the securities from the bank treasurer and
      handed them over to Rochester in good faith, supposing his room-mate would
      give the papers to Colonel McIntyre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent nodded in agreement. &ldquo;It looks that way to me,&rdquo; he said gloomily.
      &ldquo;Philip Rochester stood well in the community, his law practice is large
      and lucrative, and if it had not been for his periods of idleness and&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;hesitating&mdash;&ldquo;passion
      for good living, he would never have run into debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he got there.&rdquo; Ferguson's laugh was contemptuous. &ldquo;A desperate man
      will do anything, Mr. Kent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Kent looked dubious. &ldquo;I would believe him guilty if it were not
      for the use of aconitine&mdash;that shows premeditation on the part of the
      murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why shouldn't Rochester plan Turnbull's murder ahead of the scene in
      the police court?&rdquo; argued Ferguson. &ldquo;Wasn't he living in deadly fear of
      exposure? If he did not commit the murder, why did he run away? And if he
      is innocent, why doesn't he come forward and prove it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may not know that he is suspected of the crime,&rdquo; retorted Kent,
      rising. &ldquo;It is for us to find Rochester, and I suggest that we search this
      apartment thoroughly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already done so,&rdquo; objected Ferguson. &ldquo;And there wasn't the
      faintest clew to his hiding place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that I am not satisfied.&rdquo; Kent walked over and switched on
      another light. &ldquo;When I came here on Wednesday night I had a tussle with
      some man, but he escaped in the dark without my seeing him. I believe he
      was Rochester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are probably right.&rdquo; Ferguson crossed the room. &ldquo;And if he came back
      once, he may return again. Come ahead,&rdquo; and he plunged into the first
      bedroom. The two men subjected each room to an exhaustive search, but
      their labors were their only reward; except for an accumulation of dust,
      the apartment was undisturbed. They had reached the kitchenette-pantry
      when the gong over their heads sounded loudly, and Kent, with a muttered
      exclamation hastened toward the front door of the apartment. Ferguson,
      intent on studying the &ldquo;L&rdquo; of the building as seen from the window, was
      hardly conscious of his departure, and some seconds elapsed before he
      turned toward the door. As he gained it, he saw a dark shape dart down the
      hall. With a bound Ferguson started in pursuit, and the next second
      grappled with the flying man just as the electric lights went out and they
      were plunged in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Kent's voice echoed down the hall. &ldquo;Come here quick, Ferguson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of urgency about his appeal, and Ferguson straining his
      muscles until the blood pounded in his temples, threw the struggling man
      into a tufted arm-chair which stood by the entrance to the small dining
      room, and drawing out his handcuffs, slipped them on securely. &ldquo;Stay
      there,&rdquo; Ferguson admonished his prisoner. &ldquo;Or there will be worse coming
      to you,&rdquo; and he thrust the muzzle of his revolver against the man's
      heaving chest to illustrate his meaning; then as Kent called again, he
      sped down the hall and brought up breathless at the front door. The light
      was still burning in the corridor, though not very brightly, and he saw
      Kent hand the grinning messenger boy a shiny quarter. Touching his
      battered cap the boy went whistling away. &ldquo;Tell the elevator boy to report
      that a fuse has burned out in Mr. Rochester's apartment,&rdquo; Ferguson called
      after him, and the lad waved his hand as he dashed into the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paying no attention to the detective's call, Kent showed him a white
      envelope which bore the simple address:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   PHILIP ROCHESTER, ESQ.
                       THE SARATOGA
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the identical envelope I found in your safe,&rdquo; declared Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which disappeared last night at the Club de Vingt.&rdquo; Kent turned over
      the envelope. &ldquo;See, the red seal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a minute the men contemplated the seal with the large distinctive
      letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; in the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the letter, sir,&rdquo; Ferguson urged and Kent, his fingers fairly
      trembling, jerked and tore at the linen incased envelope; the flap ripped
      away and he opened the envelope&mdash;it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively the two men glanced down at the parquetry flooring; nothing
      but a thin coating of dust lay there, and Kent looked up and down the
      corridor; it was deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize the handwriting?&rdquo; asked Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Kent regarded the envelope in bewilderment. &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Call up the Dime Messenger Service and see where the envelope came
      from; but first come and see my prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your prisoner?&rdquo; in profound astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I caught him chasing up the hall after you,&rdquo; explained Ferguson as
      they hurriedly retraced their steps. &ldquo;I put handcuffs on him and then went
      to you. Ah, here's the light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The light, yes; but where's your prisoner?&rdquo; and Kent, who was a trifle in
      advance of his companion in reaching the dining room, stood aside to let
      Ferguson pass him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detective halted abruptly. The chair into which he had thrust his
      prisoner was vacant. The man had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one accord Ferguson and Kent advanced close to the chair, and an oath
      broke from the detective. On the cushion of the chair, still bearing the
      impress of a human body, lay a pair of shining new handcuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazedly Ferguson stooped over and examined them. They were still securely
      locked. Wheeling around Kent dashed through the door to his right and
      Ferguson, collecting his wits, searched the rest of the apartment with
      minute care. Five minutes later he came face to face with Kent in the
      living room. &ldquo;Not a trace of any kind,&rdquo; declared Kent. &ldquo;It's the same as
      the other night; the man's gone. It's&mdash;it's positively uncanny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson's face was red from mortification and his exertions combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow must have slipped from the room by that other door and out
      through the living room as we came down the hail,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you shut
      the door of the apartment, Mr. Kent, before coming down here to look at
      the prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Kent led the way back to the dining room. &ldquo;Did you recognize the
      man, Ferguson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The detective swore softly as he stared about the room. &ldquo;The lights
      went out just as I tackled him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was beastly luck that the fuse burned out at that second,&rdquo; groaned
      Kent. &ldquo;Fortune was with him in that; but how did the man get free of the
      handcuffs?&rdquo; pointing to them still lying in the chair. &ldquo;We can't attribute
      that to luck, unless&rdquo;&mdash;staring keenly at Ferguson&mdash;&ldquo;unless you
      did not snap them on the man's wrists, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; I swear it,&rdquo; declared Ferguson. &ldquo;I'm no novice at that business.
      Here, don't touch them, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; as his companion bent toward the chair.
      &ldquo;There may be finger marks on the steel; if so&rdquo;&mdash;he drew out his
      handkerchief, and taking care not to handle the burnished metal, he folded
      the handcuffs carefully in it and put them in his coat pocket. &ldquo;There's no
      use lingering here, Mr. Kent; this apartment is vacant now except for us.
      I must get to Headquarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't you better telephone for an operative and station him here?&rdquo;
       suggested Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did so while you were searching the back rooms,&rdquo; replied Ferguson.
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; as the gong sounded. &ldquo;That's Nelson, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the person who stood in the outer corridor when they opened the front
      door was not Nelson, the operative, but Dr. Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see Mr. Rochester?&rdquo; he asked, then catching sight of Kent standing
      just back of the detective, he added, &ldquo;Hello, Kent; I thought I heard some
      one walking about in here from my apartment next door, and concluded
      Rochester had returned. Can I see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; Kent spoke slowly, with a side-glance at the silent detective.
      &ldquo;Rochester has been here&mdash;and left.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XVI. THE CRIMSON OUTLINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Barbara McIntyre made the round of the library for the fifth time, testing
      each of the seven doors opening into it to see that they were closed
      behind their portieres, then she turned back to her sister, who sat
      cross-logged before a small safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo; she asked
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of replying Helen removed the key from the lock of the steel door
      and regarded it attentively. The safe was of an obsolete pattern and in
      place of the customary combination lock, was opened by means of a key,
      unique in appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly the key which father mislaid six months ago,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;Grimes found it just after father had a new key made and gave
      it to me. And yet I can't get the door open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try.&rdquo; Barbara crouched down by her sister and inserted the key
      again in the lock, but her efforts met with no results, and after five
      minutes' steady manipulation she gave up the attempt. &ldquo;I am afraid it is
      impossible,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Seems to me I have heard that the lost key
      will not open a safe after a new key has been supplied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen rose slowly to her feet, stretching her cramped limbs carefully as
      she did so, and sank down in the nearest chair. Her attitude indicated
      dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we can't find the envelope,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Hurry, Babs, and close
      the outer door; father may return at any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barbara obeyed the injunction with such alacrity that the door, concealing
      the space in the wall where stood the safe, flew to with a bang and the
      twins jumped nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen sharply. &ldquo;Do you wish to arouse the
      household?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No danger of that.&rdquo; But Barbara glanced apprehensively about the library
      in spite of her reassuring statement. &ldquo;The servants are either out or
      upstairs, and Margaret Brewster is writing letters in our sitting room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't you better go upstairs and join her?&rdquo; Helen suggested. &ldquo;Do, Babs,&rdquo;
       as her sister hesitated. &ldquo;I cannot feel sure that she will not interrupt
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my joining her won't keep Margaret upstairs,&rdquo; objected Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you can call and warn me if she is on her way down, and that will
      give me time to&mdash;to straighten father's papers,&rdquo; going over to a
      large carved table littered with magazines, letters, and silver ornaments.
      Her sister did not move, and she glanced at her with an irritated air,
      very foreign to her customary manner. &ldquo;Go, Barbara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curt command brought a stare from Barbara, but it did not accelerate
      her halting footsteps; instead she moved with even greater slowness toward
      the hall door; her active brain tormented with an unspoken and unanswered
      question. Why was Helen so anxious for her departure? She had accepted her
      offer of assistance in her search of the library with such marked
      reluctance that Barbara had marveled at the time, and now...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure, Helen, that father had the envelope in his pocket
      this morning?&rdquo; she asked for the third time since the search began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had an envelope&mdash;I caught a glimpse of the red seal,&rdquo; answered
      Helen. &ldquo;Then, just before dinner he was putting some papers in the safe.
      Oh, if Grimes had only come in a moment sooner to announce dinner, I might
      have had a chance to look in the safe before father closed the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever reply Barbara intended making was checked by the rattling of the
      knob of the hall door; it turned slowly, the door opened and, pushing
      aside the portieres drawn across the entrance, Margaret Brewster glided
      in. &ldquo;So glad to find you,&rdquo; she cooed. &ldquo;But why have you closed up the room
      and turned on all the lights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see better,&rdquo; retorted Barbara promptly as the widow's eyes roved
      around the large room, taking silent note of the drawn curtains and
      portieres, and the somewhat disarranged furniture. &ldquo;Come inside, Margaret,
      and help us in our search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; The widow tried to keep her tone natural, but a certain shrill
      alertness crept into it and Barbara, who was watching her closely, was
      quick to detect the change. Helen's color altered at the question, and she
      observed the widow's entrance with veiled hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my seal,&rdquo; Barbara answered. &ldquo;The one with the big letter 'B.' Have
      you seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&mdash;No.&rdquo; The widow took a chair uninvited near Helen. &ldquo;You look
      tired, Helen dear; why don't you go to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not sleep if I did.&rdquo; Helen passed a nervous finger across her
      eyes. &ldquo;But don't let me keep you and Babs up; it won't take me long to
      arrange to-morrow's market order for Grimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under pretense of searching for pencil and paper Helen contrived to see
      the address of every letter lying on the table, but the envelope she
      sought, with its red seal, was not among them. When she looked up again,
      pencil and paper in hand, she found Mrs. Brewster leaning lazily back and
      regarding her from under half-closed lids. &ldquo;You are very like your father,
      Helen,&rdquo; she commented softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stiffened. &ldquo;Am I? Babs and I are generally thought to resemble
      our mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In appearance, yes; but I mean mannerisms&mdash;for instance, the way of
      holding your pencil, your handwriting, even, closely resembles your
      father's.&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster pointed to the notes Helen was scribbling on the
      paper and to an open letter bearing Colonel McIntyre's signature at the
      bottom of the sheet lying beside the pad to illustrate her meaning. &ldquo;These
      are almost identical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a close observer.&rdquo; Helen completed her memorandum and laid it
      aside. &ldquo;What became of father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to a stag supper at the Willard,&rdquo; chimed in Barbara, stopping her
      aimless walk about the library. &ldquo;He said we were not to wait up for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen pushed back her chair and rose with some abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am more tired than I realized,&rdquo; she remarked and involuntarily
      stretched her weary muscles. &ldquo;Come, Margaret,&rdquo; laying a persuasive hand on
      the widow's shoulder. &ldquo;Be a trump and rub my forehead with cologne as you
      used to do abroad when I had a headache. It always put me to sleep then;
      and, oh, how I long for sleep now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was infinite pathos in her voice and Mrs. Brewster sprang up and
      threw her arm about her in ready sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor darling!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Let me put you to bed; Mammy taught me
      the art of soothing frayed nerves. Come with us, Babs,&rdquo; holding out her
      left hand to Barbara. But the latter, with a dexterous twist, slipped away
      from her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must stay and straighten the library,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster's delicate color had deepened. &ldquo;It would be as well to open
      some of the doors,&rdquo; she agreed coldly. &ldquo;The library looks odd, not to say
      funereal,&rdquo; she glanced down the spacious room and shivered ever so
      slightly. &ldquo;Do, Babs, put out some of the lights; they are blinding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll turn them all out&rdquo;&mdash;Barbara sought the electric switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to worry about father; he can find his way about in the dark like
      a cat,&rdquo; responded Barbara with unabated cheerfulness. &ldquo;Seems to me,
      Margaret, you and father are getting mighty chummy these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden darkness into which Barbara's impatient fingers, pressing
      against the electric light buttons, plunged the library and its occupants,
      prevented her seeing the curious glance which Mrs. Brewster shot at her.
      Helen, who had listened to their chatter with growing impatience, looked
      back over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry, Barbara, and come upstairs. Now, Margaret,&rdquo; and she piloted the
      widow along the hall toward the staircase without giving her an
      opportunity to answer Barbara's last remark. Barbara, pausing only long
      enough to pull back the portieres of the hall door and arrange them as
      they hung customarily, turned to go upstairs just as Grimes came down the
      hall from the dining room carrying a large tray with pitchers of ice water
      and glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had gone to your room, Grimes,&rdquo; she remarked, as the butler
      waited respectfully for her to pass him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just come in, miss, and found Murray had left the tray in the dining
      room,&rdquo; explained Grimes hurriedly. &ldquo;I hope, miss, I'll not disturb the
      ladies by knocking at their doors now with this ice water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Mrs. Brewster and Miss Helen have only just gone upstairs.&rdquo;
       Barbara paused in front of the butler and poured out a glass of water. &ldquo;I
      can't wait, Grimes, I am too thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, miss, that's all right.&rdquo; Grimes craned his head around and
      looked up and down the hail, then leaning over he placed the tray on a
      convenient table and stepped close to Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been reading the newspapers very carefully, miss,&rdquo; he began, taking
      care to keep his voice lowered. &ldquo;Especially that part of Mr. Turnbull's
      inquest which tells about the post-mortem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; asked Barbara quickly as the butler paused and again
      glanced up and down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this, miss,&rdquo; he spoke almost in a whisper. &ldquo;The doctors do say poor
      Mr. Turnbull was poisoned by acca&mdash;aconitine,&rdquo; stumbling over the
      word. &ldquo;It's a curious thing, miss, that I brought some of that very drug
      into this house last Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did!&rdquo; Barbara's fresh young voice rose in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, miss!&rdquo; The butler raised both hands. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; He glanced cautiously
      around, then continued. &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre sent me to the druggist with a
      prescription from Dr. Stone for Mrs. Brewster when she had romantic
      neuralgia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had what?&rdquo; Barbara looked puzzled, then giggled, but her mirth quickly
      altered to seriousness at sight of the butler's expression. &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster
      had a touch of rheumatic neuralgia the first of the month; do you refer to
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo; Grimes spoke more rapidly, but kept his voice lowered. &ldquo;The
      druggist told me what the pills were when I exclaimed at their size&mdash;regular
      little pellets, no bigger than that,&rdquo; he demonstrated the size with the
      tip of his little finger, and would have added more but the gong over the
      front door rang out with such suddenness that both he and Barbara started
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment, miss,&rdquo; and he hurried to the front bell, to return after a
      brief colloquy with a messenger boy, bearing a letter. &ldquo;It's for Mrs.
      Brewster, miss,&rdquo; he explained, as Barbara held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give it to her and this also,&rdquo; Barbara took the envelope and a small
      ice pitcher and glass. &ldquo;Good night, Grimes. Oh,&rdquo; she stopped midway up the
      staircase and waited for the butler to overtake her, &ldquo;Grimes, to whom did
      you give the aconitine on Sunday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't give it to nobody, miss.&rdquo; The butler was a trifle short of
      breath; his years did not permit him to keep pace with the twins. &ldquo;I was
      in a great hurry as the druggist kept me waiting, and I had to serve tea
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did you do with the aconitine pills?&rdquo; demanded Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left the box on the hail table, miss&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo; Barbara stared at the butler, then without a word she
      raced up the staircase and disappeared through the open door of Mrs.
      Brewster's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light from the hall shone through the transom and doorway in
      sufficient volume to clearly indicate the different pieces of furniture,
      and Barbara put the pitcher and glass on the bed stand and laid the letter
      which Grimes had given her on the dressing table, then went slowly into
      her own bedroom. She could hear voices, which she recognized as those of
      her sister and Mrs. Brewster, coming from Helen's bedroom, but absorbed in
      her own thoughts she undressed in the dark and crept into bed just as Mrs.
      Brewster passed down the hallway and entered her own room. The widow had
      taken off her evening gown and slippers and donned a becoming wrapper
      before she discovered the letter lying on the dresser. Drawing up a chair
      she dropped into it, let down her long dark hair, and settled back in
      luxuriant comfort against the tufted upholstery before she ran her
      well-manicured finger under the flap of the envelope. A slip of paper fell
      into her lap as she took out the contents of the envelope and she let it
      rest there while scanning the closely typewritten lines on the Metropolis
      Trust Company stationery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Mrs. Brewster, she read. Our bank teller, Mr. McDonald, has
      questioned the genuineness of the signature on the inclosed check. An
      important business engagement prevents my calling to-night, but please
      stop at the bank early to-morrow morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel that you would prefer to have a personal investigation made rather
      than have us place the matter in the hands of the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      BENJAMIN A. CLYMER.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow read the note a number of times, then bethinking herself, she
      picked up the canceled check still lying in her lap, and turned it over.
      Long and intently she studied the signature&mdash;the peculiarly
      characteristic formation of the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; caught and held her attention.
      As the seconds ticked themselves into minutes she sat immovable, her face
      as white as the hand on which she had bowed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the hall Helen McIntyre tossed from one side to the other in her
      soft bed; her restless longing to get up was growing stronger and
      stronger. While Mrs. Brewster's deft fingers and the cooling cologne had
      stopped the throbbing in her temples, they had brought only temporary
      relief in their train and not the sleep which Helen craved. She strained
      her ears to discover the time by the ticking of her clock, but either it
      was between the half or quarters of an hour, or it had stopped, for no
      chimes sounded. With a gasp of exasperation, Helen flung back the bed
      clothes and sat up. Switching on the light by the side of her bed she
      hunted for a book, but not finding any, she contemplated for a short space
      of time a pair of rubber-heeled shoes just showing themselves under the
      edge of a chair. With sudden decision she left the bed and dressed
      rapidly. It was not until she had put on her rubber-heeled shoes that she
      paused. Her hesitation, however, was but brief. Stepping to the bureau,
      she pulled out a lower drawer and running her hand inside, touched a
      concealed spring. From the cavity thus exposed she took a small automatic
      pistol, and with a stealthy glance about her, crept from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The library had been vacant fully an hour when a mouse, intent on making a
      raid on the candy which Barbara had carelessly left lying loose on one of
      the tables, paused as a faint creaking sound broke the stillness, then as
      the noise increased, the mouse scurried back to its hole. The noise
      resembled the turning of rusty hinges and the soft thud of one piece of
      wood striking another. There was a strained silence, then, from out of the
      darkness appeared a tiny stream of light directed full on a white envelope
      bearing a large red seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant the envelope was plucked from the hand holding it, and a
      figure lay crumpled on the floor from the blow of a descending weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was closely approaching one o'clock in the morning before Mrs. Brewster
      stirred from her comfortable bedroom chair. Taking up her electric torch,
      which she kept always by the side of her bed, she walked quickly down the
      staircase and into the pitch dark library. Directing her torch-light so
      that she steered a safe course among the chairs and tables, she approached
      one of the pieces of carved Venetian furniture and reached out her hand to
      touch a trap-door. As she looked for the spring she was horrified to see a
      thin stream of blood oozing through the carving until, reaching the letter
      &ldquo;B,&rdquo; it outlined that initial in sinister red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scream after scream broke from Mrs. Brewster. She was swaying upon her
      feet by the time Colonel McIntyre and his daughter Helen reached the
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret! What is it?&rdquo; McIntyre demanded. &ldquo;Calm yourself, my darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The frenzied woman shook off his soothing hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, see!&rdquo; she cried and pointed with her torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She means the Venetian casket,&rdquo; explained Helen, who had paused before
      joining them to switch on the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre gazed in amazement at the piece of furniture; then
      catching sight of the blood-stain, he raised the small trap-door or peep
      hole, in the top of the oblong box which stood breast high, supported on a
      beautifully carved base.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathless pause; then McIntyre unceremoniously jerked the
      electric torch from Mrs. Brewster's nervous fingers and turned its rays of
      the interior of the casket. Stretched at full length lay the figure of a
      man, and from a wound in his temple flowed a steady stream of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; McIntyre staggered back against Helen. &ldquo;Grimes!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. A QUESTION OF HOUSE-BREAKING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The genial president of the Metropolis Trust Company was late. Mrs.
      Brewster, waiting in his well-appointed office, restrained her ill-temper
      only by an exertion of will-power. She detested being kept waiting, and
      that morning she had many errands to attend to before the luncheon hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I use your telephone?&rdquo; she asked Mr. Clymer's secretary, and the
      young man rose with alacrity from his desk. Mrs. Brewster never knew what
      it was to lack attention, even her own sex were known on occasions to give
      her gowns and, (what captious critics termed her &ldquo;frivolous conduct&rdquo;)
      undivided attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I look up the number for you?&rdquo; the secretary asked as Mrs. Brewster
      took up the telephone book and fumbled for the gold chain of her
      lorgnette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; her smile showed each pretty dimple. &ldquo;I wish to speak to
      Mr. Kent, of the firm of Rochester and Kent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Kent?&rdquo; The young secretary dropped the book without looking at it,
      and gave a number to the operator, and then handed the instrument to Mrs.
      Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kent not in, did you say?&rdquo; asked the widow. &ldquo;Who is speaking? Ah, Mr.
      Sylvester&mdash;has Mr. Rochester returned?&mdash;-Both partners away&rdquo;...
      she paused... &ldquo;I'll call later&mdash;Mrs. Brewster, good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster hung up the receiver and turned to the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I can wait any longer,&rdquo; she began, and paused, as
      Benjamin Clymer appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So sorry to be late,&rdquo; he exclaimed, shaking her hand warmly. &ldquo;And I am
      sorry, also, to have called you here on such an errand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster waited until the young secretary had withdrawn out of
      earshot before replying; then taking the chair Clymer placed for her near
      his own, she opened her gold mesh bag and took out a canceled check and
      laid it on the desk in front of the bank president.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your bank honored this check?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who presented it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer pressed the buzzer and his secretary came at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Mr. McDonald to step here,&rdquo; and as the man vanished on his errand, he
      addressed Mrs. Brewster. &ldquo;How is Colonel McIntyre this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster's eyes opened at the question. &ldquo;Quite well,&rdquo; she replied,
      and prompted by her curiosity added: &ldquo;What made you think him ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stopped at Dr. Stone's office on the way down town, and his boy told me
      the doctor had been sent for by Colonel McIntyre,&rdquo; Clymer explained. &ldquo;I
      hope neither of the twins is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Colonel McIntyre sent for Dr. Stone to attend Grimes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The butler! Too bad he is ill; Grimes is an institution in the McIntyre
      household.&rdquo; Clymer spoke with sincere regret, and Mrs. Brewster eyed him
      approvingly; she liked good-looking men of his stamp. &ldquo;Come in, McDonald,&rdquo;
       as the bank teller appeared. &ldquo;You know Mrs. Brewster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. McDonald was one of my first acquaintances in Washington,&rdquo; and Mrs.
      Brewster smiled as she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About this check, McDonald,&rdquo; Clymer handed it to the teller as he spoke.
      &ldquo;Who presented it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Miss McIntyre?&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster put the question with swift
      intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell one twin from the other,&rdquo; confessed McDonald. &ldquo;But, as you
      see, the check is made payable to Barbara McIntyre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inference being that Barbara McIntyre presented the check for
      payment,&rdquo; commented Clymer, and McDonald bowed. &ldquo;It would seem, therefore,
      that Barbara wrote your signature on the check, Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The widow had whitened under her rouge, but her eyes did not falter
      in their direct gaze. &ldquo;The signature is genuine. I drew the check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men exchanged glances. The bank president was the first to break
      the short silence. &ldquo;In that case there is nothing more to be said,&rdquo; he
      remarked, and picking up the check handed it to Mrs. Brewster. Without a
      glance at it, she folded the paper and placed it inside her gold mesh bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not take up any more of your time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thank you&mdash;both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo; Clymer spoke impulsively. &ldquo;I'd like to shake hands with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coloring warmly, the widow slipped her small hand inside his, and with a
      friendly bow to McDonald, she walked through the bank, keeping up with
      Clymer's long strides as best she could. As they crossed the sidewalk to
      the waiting limousine they ran almost into the arms of Harry Kent, whose
      rapid gait did not suit the congested condition of the &ldquo;Wall Street&rdquo; of
      Washington. &ldquo;I tried to reach you on the telephone this morning,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mrs. Brewster, after greeting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So my clerk informed me when I saw him a few minutes ago.&rdquo; Kent helped
      her inside the limousine. &ldquo;Won't you come to my office now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that will be taking you from Mr. Clymer,&rdquo; remonstrated Mrs. Brewster.
      &ldquo;Weren't you on the way to the bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; admitted Kent. &ldquo;But I can see Mr. Clymer later in the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll be less occupied then,&rdquo; added Clymer. &ldquo;Go with Mrs. Brewster,
      Kent; good morning, madam,&rdquo; and with a courtly bow Clymer withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent's office was only around the corner, and as Mrs. Brewster kept up a
      running fire of impersonal gossip, Kent had no opportunity to satisfy his
      curiosity regarding her reasons for wanting to interview him. As the
      limousine drew up at the curb in front of his office, a man darting down
      the steps of the building, caught sight of Kent and hurried to the car
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just trying to catch you at the bank, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; he explained, and
      looking around Kent recognized Sylvester. &ldquo;There's been three telephone
      calls for you in succession from Colonel McIntyre to hurry to his home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Sylvester.&rdquo; Kent turned to Mrs. Brewster. &ldquo;Would you mind driving
      me to the McIntyre? We can talk on the way there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster picked up the speaking tube. &ldquo;Home, Harris,&rdquo; she directed,
      as the chauffeur listened for the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke as the big car started up the street but as they swung past
      old St. John's Church, Mrs. Brewster broke her silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kent,&rdquo; she drew further back in her corner. &ldquo;I claim a woman's
      privilege&mdash;to change my mind. Forget that I ever expressed a wish to
      consult you professionally, and remember, I am always glad to meet you as
      a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Mrs. Brewster, as you wish.&rdquo; Kent's tone, expressing polite
      acquiescence, covered mixed feelings. What had caused the widow to change
      her mind so suddenly, and above all, what had she wished to consult him
      about? He faced her more directly. She was charmingly gowned, and in spite
      of his perplexities, he could not but admire her air of quiet elegance and
      the soft dark eyes regarding him in friendly good-fellowship. Suddenly
      realizing that his glance had become a fixed stare, he hastily averted his
      eyes from her face, catching sight, as he did so, of the gold mesh bag
      lying in her lap. The glint of sunlight brought into prominence the
      handsomely engraved letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; on its surface. An unexpected swerve of the
      limousine, as the chauffeur turned short to avoid a speeding army truck,
      caused both Kent and Mrs. Brewster to sway forward and the gold mesh bag
      slid to the floor, carrying with it the widow's handkerchief and gold
      vanity box. Kent stooped over and picked up the articles as well as the
      contents of the mesh bag, which had opened in its descent and spilled her
      money and papers over the floor of the limousine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Brewster, as he handed her the bag, box,
      and bank notes. &ldquo;Don't bother to look for that quarter; Harris will find
      it at the garage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent ignored her remark as he again searched the floor of the car; he was
      glad of the pretext to avoid looking at the widow. He wanted time to
      collect his thoughts for, in Picking up her belongings, her handkerchief
      had caught his attention&mdash;he had seen its mate in the possession of
      Detective Ferguson, and clinging to it the broken portions of the capsules
      of amyl nitrite which Jimmie Turnbull had inhaled just before his
      mysterious death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into Kent's mind flashed Mrs. Sylvester's statement that Mrs. Brewster was
      in the police court at the time of the tragedy, although in her testimony
      at the inquest she had sworn she had not heard of Jimmie's death until the
      return of Helen and Barbara McIntyre. She had been in the police court,
      and Jimmie had used her handkerchief&mdash;a mate to the one she was then
      holding, the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; with its peculiar twist was unmistakable&mdash;and
      &ldquo;B&rdquo; stood for Brewster as well as for Barbara! Kent drew in his breath
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My handkerchief, please,&rdquo; the widow held out her hand, and after a
      moment's hesitation, Kent gave it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;I was struck by the handkerchief's
      appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster turned it over. &ldquo;In what way is the handkerchief unique?&rdquo;
       she asked, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Jimmie Turnbull crushed amyl nitrite capsules in its mate just
      before he died,&rdquo; explained Kent quietly. &ldquo;Detective Ferguson claims that
      Jimmie unintentionally broke more than one capsule in the handkerchief,
      was overcome by the powerful fumes and died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the inquest proved that Jimmie was killed by a dose of aconitine
      poison,&rdquo; she reminded him, as she tucked the handkerchief up her sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent did not reply immediately. &ldquo;A man does not usually carry a woman's
      handkerchief about with him,&rdquo; he commented slowly. &ldquo;Odd, is it not, that
      Jimmie should have used a handkerchief of yours in the police court just
      prior to his death, while you were sitting a few feet away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster turned and regarded him steadfastly. She was deadly
      white under her rouge. &ldquo;Mr. Kent, are you crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, crazy to know why you kept your presence in the police court on
      Tuesday morning a secret,&rdquo; replied Kent. In their earnestness neither
      noticed Kent's absent-minded clutch on a small folded paper which he had
      picked up from the floor of the limousine. &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster, why did you
      laugh when Dr. Stone carried Jimmie Turnbull out of the court room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster sat still in her corner of the car; so still that Kent,
      observing her closely, feared that she had fainted. She had dropped her
      eyes, and her face, set like marble, gave him no key to her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the limousine was jerked open almost before the car came to a
      full stop in front of the McIntyre residence, and Colonel McIntyre offered
      his hand to help Mrs. Brewster out. On the step she turned to Kent, who
      had lifted his hat to McIntyre in silent greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your forte lies as a romancer rather than a lawyer, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; she said,
      and not giving him time for a reply, almost ran inside the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad you could get here so soon, Kent,&rdquo; remarked McIntyre, signing to his
      chauffeur to drive on before he led the way into the house. &ldquo;Grimes has
      worked himself almost into a fever asking for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Grimes was attacked in our library early this morning by some
      unknown person, and is in bed with a bad wound on his temple and a
      tendency to hysteria,&rdquo; McIntyre explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent handed his cane and hat to the footman and followed Colonel McIntyre,
      who stalked ahead without another word. As they mounted the stairs Kent
      glanced at the folded paper which he still held, and was surprised to see
      that it was a check. The signature showed him that he had unintentionally
      walked off with Mrs. Brewster's property. His decision to hand it to
      Colonel McIntyre was checked by the Colonel disappearing inside a bedroom,
      with a muttered injunction to &ldquo;wait there,&rdquo; and Kent stuffed the check
      inside his vest pocket. It would serve as an excuse to interview Mrs.
      Brewster again before leaving the house. He was determined to have an
      answer to the question he had put to her in the limousine. Why had she
      gone to the police court, and why kept her presence there a secret?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Colonel McIntyre reappeared in the hall he was accompanied by
      Detective Ferguson. &ldquo;Sorry to keep you standing, Kent,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
      sent for you and Ferguson, first because Grimes insists on seeing you, and
      second, because I am determined that this midnight house-breaking shall be
      thoroughly investigated and put an end to. This way,&rdquo; and he led them into
      a large airy bedroom on the third floor, to which Grimes had been carried
      unconscious that morning, instead of to his own bedroom in the servants'
      quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimes, with his head swathed in bandages, was a woe-begone object. He
      greeted Colonel McIntyre and the detective with a sullen glare, but his
      eyes brightened at sight of Kent, and he moved a feeble hand in welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sirs,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;There's chairs for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry about us,&rdquo; remarked McIntyre cheerily. &ldquo;Just tell us how you
      got that nasty knock on the head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno, sir; it came like a clap o' thunder,&rdquo; Grimes tried to lift his
      head, but gave over the attempt as excruciating pain followed the effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hour of the morning was it?&rdquo; asked Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About one o'clock, as near as I can tell, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what were you doing in the library at that hour, Grimes?&rdquo; demanded
      McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying to find out what your household was up to, sir,&rdquo; was Grimes'
      unexpected answer, and McIntyre started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain your meaning, Grimes,&rdquo; he commanded sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can do it better than I can, sir,&rdquo; retorted Grimes. &ldquo;You know the
      reason every one's searching the room with the seven doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room with the seven doors!&rdquo; echoed Ferguson. &ldquo;Which is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grimes means the library.&rdquo; McIntyre's tone was short. &ldquo;I have no idea,
      Grimes, what your allegations mean. Be more explicit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler eyed him in no friendly fashion. &ldquo;Wasn't Mr. Turnbull arrested
      in that very room?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And what was he looking for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull's presence has been explained,&rdquo; replied McIntyre. &ldquo;He came
      here disguised as a burglar on a wager with my daughter, Miss Barbara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, did he now?&rdquo; Grimes' rising inflection indicated nervous tension.
      &ldquo;Did a man with a bad heart come here in the dead of night for nothing but
      that foolishness?&rdquo; Grimes glared at his three visitors. &ldquo;You bet he
      didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson, who had followed the dialogue between McIntyre and his servant
      with deep attention, addressed the excited man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did Mr. Turnbull enter Colonel McIntyre's library on Monday night
      disguised as a burglar?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimes, by a twist of his head, managed to regard the detective out of the
      corner of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, why did he?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;That's what I went to the library last
      night to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you discover anything?&rdquo; The question shot from McIntyre, and both
      Ferguson and Kent watched him as they waited for Grimes' reply. The butler
      took his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre threw himself back in his chair and his eyebrows rose in
      interrogation as he touched his forehead significantly and glanced at
      Grimes. That the butler caught his meaning was evident from his
      expression, but he said nothing. The detective was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear any one break into the house when you were prowling around,
      Grimes?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective turned to Colonel McIntyre. &ldquo;After finding Grimes did you
      search the house?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The patrolman, O'Ryan, and my new footman, Murray, went with me
      through the entire house, and we found all doors and windows to the front
      and rear of the house securely locked,&rdquo; responded McIntyre; &ldquo;except the
      window of the reception room on the ground floor. That was closed but
      unlatched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent wondered if the grimace which twisted the butler's face was meant for
      a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That there window was locked when I went to bed,&rdquo; Grimes stated with slow
      distinctness. &ldquo;And I was the last person in this house to go to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre started to speak when Ferguson stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just let me handle this case,&rdquo; he said persuasively. &ldquo;You have called in
      the police,&rdquo; and as McIntyre commenced some uncomplimentary remark, he
      added with sternness. &ldquo;Don't interfere, sir. Now, Grimes, your statements
      imply one of two things&mdash;some member of the household either went
      downstairs after you had retired, and opened the window in the reception
      room to admit the person who afterwards attacked you in the library, or&rdquo;&mdash;Ferguson
      paused significantly, &ldquo;some member of this household knocked you senseless
      in the library. Which was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a tense silence. McIntyre, by an obvious effort, refrained from
      speech as they waited for Grimes' answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno who hit me.&rdquo; Grimes avoided looking at the three men. &ldquo;But some
      one did, and that window in the reception room was locked when I went
      upstairs to my bedroom after every one had retired. I'm telling you God's
      truth, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre eyed him in wrathful silence, then turned to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blow has knocked Grimes silly,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;There is certainly no
      motive for any of us to attack Grimes, nor has any trace of a weapon been
      found such as must have been used against Grimes. O'Ryan and I looked
      particularly for it, after removing Grimes from the Venetian casket, where
      my daughter Helen, Mrs. Brewster and I discovered him lying unconscious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this Venetian casket like?&rdquo; asked Ferguson before Kent could
      question McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fine sample of carving of the Middle Ages,&rdquo; replied McIntyre. &ldquo;I
      purchased the pair when in Venice years ago. They are over six feet in
      length, about three feet wide, and rest on a carved base. There is a door
      at the end through which it was customary in the Middle Ages to slide the
      body, after embalming, for the funeral ceremonies, after which the body
      was removed, placed in another casket and buried. There is a square
      opening or peep hole on the top of the casket through which you can look
      at the body; a cleverly concealed door covers this opening. In fact,&rdquo;
       added McIntyre, &ldquo;the door at the end is not at first discernible, and is
      hard to open, unless one has the knack of doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! It looks as if whoever put Grimes inside the casket was familiar
      with it,&rdquo; remarked Ferguson dryly, and McIntyre bit his lip. &ldquo;Guess I'll
      go and take a look at the casket. I'll come back, Grimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent rose with the others and started to follow them to the door, but
      Grimes beckoned him to approach the bed. The butler waited until he heard
      McIntyre's heavy tread and the lighter footfall of the detective recede
      down the hall before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only going to say, sir,&rdquo; he whispered as Kent, at a sign from him,
      stooped over the bed, &ldquo;I got a box of aconitine pills for Mrs. Brewster on
      Sunday&mdash;the stuff that poisoned Mr. Turnbull,&rdquo; he paused to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go on,&rdquo; urged Kent, catching the man's excitement. &ldquo;You gave it to
      Mrs. Brewster&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I didn't; I left the box on the hall table,&rdquo; Grimes cleared his
      throat nervously. &ldquo;I dunno who picked up that box o' poison, Mr. Kent; so
      help me God, I dunno!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent thought rapidly. &ldquo;Have you told any one of this?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grimes nodded. &ldquo;Only one person,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I spoke to Miss Barbara
      last night as she was going to bed.&rdquo; Grimes laid a hot hand on Kent's and
      glanced fearfully around the room. &ldquo;Bend nearer, sir; I don't want none
      other to hear me. Just before I got that knockout blow in the library last
      night, I heard the swish o' skirts&mdash;and Miss Barbara was the only
      living person who knew I knew about the poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared in stupefaction at the butler. He was aroused by a cold voice
      from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are waiting for you, Kent,&rdquo; and Colonel McIntyre stood aside to let
      him pass from the room ahead of him, then without a backward glance at the
      injured butler, he closed and locked the bedroom door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. THE FATAL PERIOD
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Kent walked into the library he found Colonel McIntyre by his side; the
      latter's even breathing gave no indication of the haste he had made down
      the staircase to catch up with Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detective Ferguson hardly noted their arrival, his attention being given
      wholly to the examination of the Venetian casket which had played such an
      important part in the drama of the night before. The casket and its
      companion piece stood on either side of the room near a window recess. The
      long straight shape of the high boxes on their graceful base gave no
      indication of the use to which they had been put in ancient days, but made
      attractive as well as unique pieces of furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent crossed the library and, after looking inside the casket, examined
      the exterior with care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch that crest,&rdquo; cautioned Ferguson, observing that Kent's glance
      remained focused on the blood-stained, raised letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; and the carving
      back of it. &ldquo;In fact, don't touch any part of the casket, I'm trying to
      get finger prints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent barely heard the warning as he turned to McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I seen that letter 'B' design on your stationery, Colonel?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barbara uses it,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;She fancied the antique lettering, and
      copied the 'B' for the engraver; she is handy with her pen, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she wish the 'B' for a seal?&rdquo; inquired Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she had a seal made like it also.&rdquo; McIntyre moved closer to the
      casket. &ldquo;Found anything, Ferguson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective withdrew his head from the opening at the end of the casket,
      and regarded the furniture vexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;Except I am convinced that it required
      dexterity to slip Grimes inside the casket. The butler is small and
      slight, but he must have been unconscious from that tap on the forehead
      and, therefore, a dead weight. Whoever picked him up must have been some
      athlete, and&rdquo;&mdash;running his eyes up and down Colonel McIntyre's
      well-knit, erect frame&mdash;&ldquo;pretty familiar with the workings of this
      casket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! It's not so difficult a feat,&rdquo; McIntyre shrugged his shoulders
      disdainfully. &ldquo;My daughters, as children, used to play hide and seek
      inside the casket with each new governess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson stepped forward briskly. &ldquo;Mr. Kent, let me see if I can lift you
      inside the casket; make yourself limp&mdash;that's it!&rdquo; as Kent, entering
      into the investigation heart and soul, relaxed his muscles and fell back
      against the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he was swung upward and pushed head-first inside the casket
      and the door closed. The air, though close, was not unpleasant and Kent,
      his eyes growing gradually accustomed to the dark interior, tried to
      discover the trap door at the top of the box but without success. Putting
      out his hands he felt along the top. The height of the casket did not
      permit him to sit up, so he was obliged to slide his body down toward his
      feet to feel along the sides of the casket. This maneuver soon brought his
      knees in violent contact with the top, and at the sound Ferguson opened
      the door and assisted him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had enough of it?&rdquo; he asked, viewing Kent's reddened cheeks with faint
      amusement. &ldquo;I wonder if Grimes could breathe in there for any lengthy
      period. If so, it would help establish the time which elapsed between his
      being incarcerated and your finding him, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; demanded McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if he couldn't get air and you hadn't discovered him at once, he'd
      have died,&rdquo; explained Ferguson. &ldquo;If you did find him immediately the
      person who knocked him down must have made a lightning escape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air does get in the casket in some way,&rdquo; broke in Kent. &ldquo;It wasn't so bad
      inside. Colonel McIntyre,&rdquo; Kent stopped a moment to remove a piece of red
      sealing wax clinging to the cuff of his suit. It had not been there when
      he entered the casket. Kent dropped the wax in his vest pocket as he again
      addressed his host. &ldquo;Who first discovered Grimes in the casket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was Mrs. Brewster doing in the library at that hour?&rdquo; glancing
      keenly at McIntyre as he put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could not sleep and came down for a book,&rdquo; explained the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson, who had walked several times around the library, looking behind
      first one and then the other of the seven doors, paused to ask:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What attracted Mrs. Brewster's attention to the casket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blood stain on its side,&rdquo; McIntyre answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;that!&rdquo; Ferguson eyed McIntyre incredulously. &ldquo;Come, sir, do
      you mean to tell me she noticed that little bit of a stain in a dark
      room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had an electric torch,&rdquo; shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should she turn the torch on this casket?&rdquo; persisted the
      detective. &ldquo;She came to the library for a book, and the bookcases are in
      another part of the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, but the book she wished was lying on the top of this casket,&rdquo;
       replied McIntyre, meeting their level looks with one equally steadfast. &ldquo;I
      know because I left the book there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson glanced from McIntyre to Kent and back again at the Colonel in
      non-plussed silence. The explanation was pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to talk with Mrs. Brewster,&rdquo; he remarked dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; McIntyre pressed an electric button. The summons was answered
      immediately by the new servant, Murray. &ldquo;Ask Mrs. Brewster if she can see
      Detective Ferguson in the library, Murray,&rdquo; McIntyre directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir, but Mrs. Brewster has just gone out,&rdquo; and with a bow
      Murray withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent, who had drawn forward a chair preparatory to sitting down and
      participating in the interview with the widow, changed his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must leave at once,&rdquo; he said, after consulting his watch. &ldquo;Please
      inform Mrs. Brewster, Colonel, that I will be in my office this afternoon,
      and I expect her to make me the visit she postponed this morning.
      Ferguson,&rdquo; turning back to address the detective, &ldquo;you'll find me at the
      Saratoga for the next hour. Good morning,&rdquo; and paying no attention to
      Colonel McIntyre's request to remain, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one in the hall and Kent debated a moment whether or not to
      ring for the servant and ask to see Barbara, but, at sight of the hall
      table, Grimes' confidences recurred to him and drove everything else out
      of his mind. Stopping before the table he contemplated its smooth surface
      before moving the few ornaments it held. Satisfied that no pillbox stood
      behind any of them, he pulled open the two drawers and tumbled their
      contents about. His efforts only brought to light some half-empty
      cigarette boxes, matches, a scratch pad or two, and old visiting cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent shut the drawers, picked up his hat, and took his cane from the tall
      china umbrella-stand by the hall table. As he stepped through the front
      doorway he caught sight of the end of his cane, which he was carrying
      tucked under his arm. Fastened to the ferule of the cane was the round top
      of a paste-board pill box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent backed so swiftly into the house again that his figure blocked the
      closing of the front door, which he had started to pull shut after him.
      Letting the door close gently he walked back to the umbrella stand. It was
      a tall heavy affair, and he had some difficulty in tipping it over and
      letting its contents spill on the floor. A soft exclamation escaped him as
      three little pellets rolled past him, and then came the bottom of a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      With hasty fingers Kent picked them up, placed them in the box, and fitted
      on the top, first carefully smoothing over the hole made by his cane when
      thrust into the umbrella stand by the footman. Replacing the stand he
      wrapped the box containing the pills in his handkerchief and hurried from
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent found the operative from Detective Headquarters sitting on duty in
      Rochester's living room when he entered that apartment a quarter of an
      hour later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one called here?&rdquo; he asked, as the man, whom he had met the night
      before, greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a soul, Mr. Kent.&rdquo; Nelson suppressed a yawn; his relief was late in
      coming, and he had had little sleep the night before. &ldquo;There's been no
      disturbance of any kind, not even a ring at the telephone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent considered a moment, then sat down by the telephone and gave a number
      to Central.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Sylvester?&rdquo; he called into the mouth-piece. &ldquo;If Mrs. Brewster
      comes to the office, telephone me at Mr. Rochester's apartment, Franklin
      52. Don't let Mrs. Brewster leave until I have seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; came the reply, and Kent hung up the receiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had any luncheon?&rdquo; he asked Nelson as the man loitered around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet&rdquo;&mdash;Nelson's eyes brightened at the word. It was long past his
      usual meal hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run down to the cafe on the first floor and tell the head waiter to give
      you a square meal and charge it to me,&rdquo; Kent directed. &ldquo;Order something
      substantial; you must be used up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hung back. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Kent, but I don't like to leave here
      until my relief comes,&rdquo; he objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, I'll stay in the apartment until you return,&rdquo; and Kent
      settled the question by opening the door leading into the outer corridor.
      &ldquo;Ferguson will be around shortly, so hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent watched the man scurry toward the elevator shaft, then returned to
      Rochester's apartment and once more took up the telephone. The operative's
      reluctance to leave the apartment unguarded had altered his plans
      somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Dr. Stone's office?&rdquo; he asked a moment later, as a faint &ldquo;hello,&rdquo;
       came over the wire. &ldquo;Oh, doctor, this is Kent. Please come over to
      Rochester's apartment; I would like to consult you in regard to an
      important matter. You'll come now? Thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor kept Kent waiting less than five minutes. The clock was
      striking one when he appeared, bland and smiling. Hardly waiting for him
      to select a seat Kent flung himself into a chair in front of Rochester's
      desk and laid the pill box on the writing pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, doctor,&rdquo; he began, and his manner gained in seriousness, &ldquo;what, in
      your opinion, killed Jimmie Turnbull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The post-mortem examination proved that he had swallowed aconitine in
      sufficient quantity to cause death,&rdquo; Stone replied. &ldquo;He undoubtedly died
      from the effects of that poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is aconitine difficult to procure?&rdquo; asked Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is often prescribed for fevers.&rdquo; Stone made himself comfortable in a
      near-by chair. &ldquo;Aconitine is the alkaloid of aconite. I believe that in
      India it is frequently employed, not only for the destruction of wild
      beasts, but for criminal purposes. The India variety is known as the Bish
      poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent started&mdash;Bish poison&mdash;was he never to get away from the
      letter &ldquo;B&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you procure Bish in this country?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone considered the question. &ldquo;You might be able to purchase it from some
      Hindoo residing or traveling in the United States,&rdquo; he said, after a
      pause. &ldquo;I doubt if you could buy it in a drug store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent heaved a sigh of relief as he hitched his chair closer to the
      physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you prescribe a dose of aconitine for Mrs. Brewster recently?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, for an attack of rheumatic neuralgia.&rdquo; Stone eyed him curiously.
      &ldquo;What then, Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the box the medicine came in?&rdquo; and Kent placed the cover in
      Stone's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stone turned the paste-board over and studied the defaced label. &ldquo;I cannot
      answer that question positively,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The label bears my name and
      that of the druggist, but the directions are missing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the number's on it,&rdquo; put in Kent swiftly. &ldquo;Come, Stone, call up the
      druggist, repeat the number to him, and ask if it calls for your aconitine
      prescription.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone hesitated as if about to speak, then, reaching out his hand, he
      picked up the telephone and held a short conversation with the drug clerk
      of the Thompson Pharmacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the box which contained the aconitine pills for Mrs. Brewster,&rdquo;
       he said, when he had replaced the telephone. &ldquo;Now, Kent, I have secured
      the information you wished; kindly tell me your reasons for desiring it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Kent's turn to hesitate. &ldquo;Do you know many instances where
      aconitine was used by murderers?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no. I believe it was the drug used in the celebrated Lamson poison
      case,&rdquo; replied the physician slowly. &ldquo;I cannot recall any others just at
      the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about suicides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is seldom, if ever, used for suicides.&rdquo; Stone spoke with more
      assurance. &ldquo;I have found in my practice, Kent, that suicides can be
      classed as follows: drowning by the young, pistols by the adult, and
      hanging by the aged; women generally prefer asphyxiation, using
      illuminating gas. But this is beside the question, unless&rdquo;&mdash;bending a
      penetrating look at his companion&mdash;&ldquo;unless you believe Jimmie
      Turnbull committed suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That idea has occurred to me,&rdquo; admitted Kent. &ldquo;But it doesn't square with
      other facts which have developed, nor is it in keeping with the character
      of the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men who suffer from a mortal disease sometimes commit desperate acts, not
      at all in accord with their previous conduct,&rdquo; responded Stone gravely.
      &ldquo;Come, Kent, you have not answered my question. Why did you wish
      information about this box of aconitine pills prescribed for Mrs. Brewster
      during her attack of neuralgia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just stated that aconitine is not usually administered to murder
      a person,&rdquo; Kent spoke seriously, choosing his words with care. &ldquo;Do you
      wonder then, that I consider it more than a coincidence that Jimmie
      Turnbull should have died from a dose of that poison, and that the drug
      should have been prescribed for one of the inmates of the house he visited
      shortly before his death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician sat upright, his face had grown gray. &ldquo;Mr. Kent,&rdquo; he
      commenced indignantly, &ldquo;are you aware what you are insinuating? Are you,
      also, aware that Mrs. Brewster is my cousin, a charming, honorable woman,
      without a stain on her character?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent set the bottom of the box containing the pills in front of the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found out that this box, with its dangerous drug, was left on the
      hall table in the McIntyre house; apparently any one had access to its
      contents, therefore my remarks are not directed against Mrs. Brewster any
      more than against any person in the McIntyre household, from the Colonel
      to the servants. I found these three pills at the McIntyre house this
      morning; how many did your prescription call for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone picked up the small pills and, as he balanced them in his palm, his
      manner grew more alert. Suddenly he dropped two back in the box and
      touched the third pill with the tip of his tongue; not content with that
      he crushed it in his fingers, sniffed the drug, and again tested it with
      his tongue. His expression was peculiar as he looked up at Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are not aconitine pills,&rdquo; he stated positively. &ldquo;They are
      nitro-glycerine. How did they get in this box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent rubbed his chin in bewilderment. The box bearing the aconitine label
      and the pills had all rolled out of the china umbrella stand, and he had
      taken it for granted that the pills belonged in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found them loose in the same receptacle,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And concluded
      they were what remained of the aconitine pills which Grimes, the McIntyre
      butler, said he left on the hall table Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone smiled with what Kent, who was watching him closely, judged to be an
      odd mixture of relief and apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have found more dissimilar medicine to go in this pill box,
      although the two kinds of pills are identical in color and size,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Aconitine depresses the heart action while the other stimulates it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician's statement fell on deaf ears. Raising his head after
      contemplating the pills, Kent had looked across the room and his glance
      had fallen on a wing chair, standing just inside the doorway of the living
      room, and thrown partly in shadow by the portieres. The wing of the chair
      appeared to move. Kent rubbed his eyes and looking again, caught the same
      slight movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bounding toward the chair Kent saw that the brown shape which he had
      mistaken for part of the tufted upholstery was the sleek brown hair of a
      man's well-shaped head. He halted abruptly on meeting the gaze of a pair
      of mocking eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rochester?&rdquo; he gasped unbelievingly. &ldquo;Rochester!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His partner laughed softly as Stone approached. &ldquo;I have been an interested
      listener,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me complete the good doctor's argument.
      Nitro-glycerine would have benefitted Jimmie Turnbull and his feeble
      heart; whereas the missing aconitine pills killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone regarded him with severity. &ldquo;How did you get in this apartment?&rdquo; he
      demanded, declining the challenge Rochester had offered in addressing his
      opinion of Turnbull's death directly to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rochester dangled his bunch of keys in the physician's face and smiled at
      his excited partner. &ldquo;If you two hadn't been so absorbed in your
      conversation you would have heard me walk in,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been?&rdquo; demanded Kent, partly recovering from his
      astonishment which had deprived him of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decided to take a vacation at a moment's notice.&rdquo; Rochester spoke with
      the same slow drawl which was characteristic of him. &ldquo;You should be
      accustomed to my eccentricities by this time, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are,&rdquo; announced Detective Ferguson from the hallway, where he and
      Nelson had been silent witnesses of the scene. &ldquo;And we'll give you a
      chance to explain them in the police court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what charge?&rdquo; demanded Rochester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poisoning your room-mate, Mr. Turnbull,&rdquo; replied the detective, drawing
      out a pair of handcuffs. &ldquo;You are mighty clever, Mr. Rochester. I've got
      to hand it to you for your mysterious disappearances in and out of this
      apartment, and for murdering Mr. Turnbull right in the police court in the
      presence of the judge, police officials, and spectators.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stepped forward at sight of the handcuffs and laid a restraining hand
      on the detective's shoulder. Rochester saw the movement, guessed Kent's
      intention, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can settle the case here,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;No need of troubling
      the police judge. Now, Mr. Detective, how did I kill Jimmie Turnbull
      before all those people without any one becoming aware of the fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slipped the poison in the glass of water you handed him,&rdquo; answered
      Ferguson promptly. &ldquo;A nervy sleight-of-hand, but you'll swing for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rochester's smile was exasperating as he turned to Dr. Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging from Stone's remarks about aconitine&mdash;which I overheard,&rdquo; he
      interpolated. &ldquo;I gather the doctor is tolerably familiar with the action
      of the drug. Does aconitine kill instantly, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stone cleared his throat before speaking. &ldquo;No; the fatal period averages
      about four hours,&rdquo; he said, and Rochester's eyes sparkled as he looked up
      at the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie died almost immediately after I handed him that drink of water,&rdquo;
       he declared. &ldquo;If you wish to know who administered that aconitine poison,
      you will have to find out who Jimmie was with at the McIntyre house in the
      early hours of Tuesday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sharp imperative ring of the telephone bell cut the silence which
      followed. Kent, standing nearest the instrument, picked it up, and
      recognized Sylvester's voice over the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A message has just come, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;from Mrs. Brewster saying
      that she will be in your office at four o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. THE RED SEAL AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Harry Kent inserted his key in his office door with more vigor than good
      judgment, and spent some seconds in re-adjusting it in the lock. Once
      inside the office he put up the latch and closed the door. A glance around
      the empty office showed him that Sylvester had obeyed his telephone
      instructions and gone out to luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent noted with satisfaction as he put his hat and cane in the coat closet
      that he had over two hours before Mrs. Brewster's expected arrival; ample
      time in which to consider in quietude the events of the past few days, and
      plan for his interview with the pretty widow. He had spent the time
      between Rochester's sudden reappearance and a hastily swallowed lunch at a
      downtown cafe, in arranging bail for Rochester. Ferguson had proved
      obdurate and had persisted in taking the lawyer to Police Headquarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Stone had accompanied the trio, and his testimony, supported by two
      chemists, regarding the time required for aconitine poison to act, had
      gone far to weaken the detective's case against Rochester.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rochester, to Kent's unbounded astonishment, had appeared indifferent to
      the whole proceedings; and to his partner's urgent inquiries as to where
      he had spent the past four days, and why he had disappeared, he had
      returned one invariable answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll explain in good time, Harry,&rdquo; and it was not until they were leaving
      Police Headquarters that his apathy vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you to see Mrs. Brewster?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be at our office at four o'clock. Say, Phil&rdquo;&mdash;but
      Rochester, shaking off his detaining hand, darted across the street and
      sprang into a passing taxi bearing the sign, &ldquo;For Hire,&rdquo; and that was the
      last Kent had seen of his elusive partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent dropped into his chair and glanced askance at the mail piled in neat
      array on his desk; he was not in a frame of mind to handle routine office
      business. Other clients would have to wait until later in the day. A
      memorandum pad, bearing a message in Sylvester's precise penmanship
      attracted his wandering attention and he picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kent:&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;Colonel McIntyre called just after I talked with you
      on the 'phone; he waited in your office for half an hour, then left,
      stating he would come back. Miss Barbara McIntyre called immediately
      afterwards, but would not wait more than five minutes. Mr. Clymer came as
      she was going out and left a note on your desk. I will return soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SYLVESTER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent laid down the pad and picked up a twisted three-cornered note bearing
      his name in pencil. Unfolding it, he scanned the hurriedly written lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Kent&mdash;McIntyre telephoned there were new developments in the
      Turnbull affair. Will be back later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B. A. CLYMER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent judged from the use of his initials that Clymer was stirred out of
      his ordinary calm, nothing else explained his failure to sign his full
      name, and he wondered what confidences McIntyre had made to the bank
      president.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tossing down the note, Kent lighted his pipe, tilted back in his swivel
      chair, and reviewed the facts which implicated Rochester in Jimmie
      Turnbull's murder. Rochester's quarrels with Jimmie, his persistent
      assertion that his friend had died from angina pectoris, his unexplained
      disappearance on Tuesday night, the fake telegram from Cleveland stating
      he was there, the withdrawal of his bank deposits, the forged checks, his
      mysterious visits to his own apartment, when considered together,
      presented a chain of circumstantial evidence connecting him with the
      crime. But in the light of Dr. Stone's testimony, the poison &ldquo;could not
      have been administered in the glass of water Rochester had given Jimmie in
      the police court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four hours at least had to elapse before the fatal dose of aconitine could
      take effect&mdash;four hours! Kent told them off on his fingers; it placed
      the crime in the McIntyre house. Which one of its inmates administered the
      poison to Jimmie and how had it been done? What motive had prompted the
      cashier's murder?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was preposterous to think that either of the twins was guilty of the
      crime. Helen's devotion to Jimmie, her insistence upon an autopsy being
      held indicated her innocence. She had stated at the inquest that she had
      not known the burglar's identity; Kent paused as the thought occurred to
      him&mdash;the twins had swapped identities on the witness stand, and
      therefore Helen had not been called upon to answer that question! To the
      best of his recollection she had only been asked if she had recognized
      Jimmie in the court room and not at her home. But Helen it was who had
      summoned Officer O'Ryan on discovering the burglar and had him arrested.
      She surely would never have done so had she guessed his identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Barbara McIntyre&mdash;Kent's heart beat faster at thought of the
      girl he loved so well. Circumstantial evidence had seemed for a time to
      involve her in the crime. Grimes' outrageous insinuation that he had been
      assaulted on account of confiding to her that the box of aconitine pills
      had been left on the hall table where any one could get them, was the
      outcome of his battered condition. When physical strength returned, the
      butler would forget his hallucinations. The handkerchief with its
      embroidered letter &ldquo;B,&rdquo; used by Jimmie to inhale the fumes from his amyl
      nitrite capsules, was finally traced to its rightful owner&mdash;Mrs.
      Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Brewster was due in his office within a very short time. Kent's
      square jaw became more pronounced; she should not leave until she had
      either confessed her connection with Turnbull's death, or established her
      innocence. Surely it would be easy for Mrs. Brewster to do so, but&mdash;aconitine
      had been prescribed for her; she was familiar with the poison, she had it
      at hand, she went to the police court, and kept her trip a secret, and she
      had laughed when Jimmie was carried dying from the court room. But what
      motive could have inspired her to murder Jimmie? Was he an old lover&mdash;Kent,
      unable to keep quiet any longer, rose and paced up and down the office,
      stopping a moment to glance out of the window. As he passed the safe he
      saw the door was ajar. Kent paused abruptly. Who had opened the safe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing to the outer office he looked around; no one was there. It
      flashed into Kent's mind that he had seen Rochester's light top coat and
      walking stick in the coat closet as he hung up his hat on his arrival, and
      he again opened the closet door. The coat and stick were still there; so
      Rochester had come to the office immediately after leaving him, and
      carelessly left the safe open! Kent smiled in spite of his vexation; the
      act was typical of his eccentric partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back to his own office Kent opened the safe and glanced inside. The
      pigeon holes and compartments appeared untouched, except the door of one
      small compartment on Rochester's side. An envelope was wedged in such a
      manner that the small door would not shut and that had prevented the
      closing of the outer safe door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent, preparatory to shutting the safe, drew out the envelope intending to
      place it in another pigeon-hole where there was more room. As he turned
      the envelope over he was thunderstruck to recognize it as the one which
      Helen McIntyre had placed in the safe on Wednesday morning. He had last
      seen the envelope lying on the table in the smoking porch of the Club de
      Vingt, from whence it had mysteriously disappeared, and now it was back
      again in Rochester's safe!
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it ever been missing from the safe? The question forced itself on Kent
      as he returned to his chair, envelope in hand, and sat down before his
      desk. He had accepted Detective Ferguson's statement that he had removed
      the envelope from the safe, and therefore had never looked in the
      compartment where Helen had put it to verify its disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson had removed it, Kent concluded as he examined the envelope with
      more care; it was the identical one, unaddressed, with the same red seal
      holding down the flap. The same red seal, but with a difference&mdash;a
      corner was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent stared at the seal for a moment in doubt, then his fingers sought his
      vest pocket and fumbled about for a minute. Taking out Mrs. Brewster's
      check, he laid it on the desk alongside the envelope, unfolded it, and
      picked out a piece of red sealing wax which had slid inside the check.
      Kent placed the red wax on the broken section of the seal&mdash;it fitted
      exactly, forming a perfect letter &ldquo;B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent sat in dumbfounded silence, regarding the red seal and the envelope.
      The piece of wax broken off from the seal had caught on his coat sleeve
      when he had been in the Venetian casket in the library at the McIntyre
      house. It was proof positive that not only he had been in the casket, but
      the sealed envelope also. Helen McIntyre had left the envelope in his
      care. Mrs. Brewster and Colonel McIntyre had both been present when the
      envelope was stolen from him. Which of them had taken it? Which one had
      afterwards secreted it in the Venetian casket? And which had brought it
      back to the safe in his office?
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel McIntyre had been in his office within the hour&mdash;the question
      was answered, and Kent's eyes brightened, then clouded&mdash;Barbara had
      been there as well, and Grimes had stated that before he received a
      knock-out blow in the McIntyre library he heard the swish of skirts!
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent laid his hand on the envelope. It was time that he found out what it
      contained; but his finger, inserted under the flap, paused as his eyes
      fell on the check bearing Mrs. Brewster's signature. It was the check he
      had picked up from the floor of the McIntyre limousine that morning and
      inadvertently carried away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her signature his glance wandered to Sylvester's memorandum pad; it
      was uncanny the way his eye picked out the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; as he stared at
      Clymer's note and its signature. Slowly his hand dropped away from the
      envelope and he left it lying forgotten on the desk as he picked up piece
      after piece of blotting paper, glancing intently at each and finally,
      pulling open a drawer of his desk, he hunted in feverish haste for a
      hand-mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ten minutes later Kent rose, placed the papers he had been examining
      in the inside pocket of his coat and, using the private entrance from his
      office into the corridor, he hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Helen McIntyre entered the office of Rochester and Kent for the
      second time that afternoon she found Sylvester transcribing stenographic
      notes on his typewriter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kent is expecting you, miss,&rdquo; he said, holding open the inner office
      door, and with a courteous word of thanks, Helen passed the clerk and the
      door closed behind her. Kent rose at her approach and bowed formally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this chair,&rdquo; he suggested, and not until she was seated did Helen
      realize he had placed her where the light fell full upon her. &ldquo;I asked you
      to come here,&rdquo; he began, as she waited for him to speak, &ldquo;Because I must
      have your confidence&mdash;if I am to aid you. Did you meet, recognize,
      and talk to Jimmie Turnbull in your house sometime between Monday midnight
      and his arrest on Tuesday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She colored hotly, then paled. &ldquo;My testimony at the inquest,&rdquo;&mdash;she
      commenced, but he gave her no opportunity to add more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your testimony there does not cover the question,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You
      stated then that you had not recognized Jimmie in the court room. Had you
      already penetrated his disguise at your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; Kent was doggedly persistent, and Helen's fingers closed around
      her handbag with convulsive force. Why had she not sent Barbara to see
      Kent in her place?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I what?&rdquo; she parried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you recognize and talk with Jimmie Turnbull in your house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked with him, yes,&rdquo; she admitted, and her voice dropped almost to a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Jimmie Turnbull or Smith the burglar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Jimmie&rdquo;&mdash;she confessed, after a slight pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you go through the farce of having Jimmie arrested as a
      burglar?&rdquo; Kent demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that Barbara might win her wager,&rdquo; promptly. Kent stared at her
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that, notwithstanding the risk to which you were subjecting
      him with his weak heart, you kept up the farce simply that Barbara might
      win an idiotic wager?&rdquo; Kent asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen passed one nervous hand over the other; her palms were hot and dry,
      and two hectic spots had appeared in each white cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie was quite well Monday night,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;He&mdash;he&mdash;had
      some heart medicine with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amyl nitrite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nitro-glycerine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think that was it, I am not quite sure,&rdquo; she spoke with
      uncertainty, and Kent knew that she lied. His heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he swallow any medicine in your presence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;No, he did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent lowered his voice. &ldquo;Did you see him take Mrs. Brewster's aconitine
      pills off the hall table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen shifted her gaze to his face and then back to her ever restless
      hands. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not see him take the pills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent studied her in a silence which, to her, seemed never-ending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want the true answer to this question,&rdquo; he announced with meaning
      emphasis. &ldquo;Why did Jimmie go in disguise to your house on Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen blanched. &ldquo;How should I know,&rdquo; she muttered evasively. &ldquo;He&mdash;he
      didn't come to see me&mdash;the admission was barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know what transpired in your house on Monday night?&rdquo; demanded
      Kent eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His question met with no response, and he repeated it, but still the girl
      remained silent. Kent gave her a moment's grace, then drawing out the
      unaddressed envelope from his pocket he held it toward her. A low cry
      broke from her, and her expression changed as she caught sight of the
      broken seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have opened it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Kent held the envelope just beyond her reach. &ldquo;I will only give
      it to you with the understanding that you open the envelope now in my
      presence and let me see its contents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen drew back, then impulsively extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Give me the envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; The word rang out, startling Kent as well as Helen, and Mrs.
      Brewster, whose noiseless entrance a few seconds before had gone
      unobserved, hurried to them. &ldquo;The envelope is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE UNKNOWN EQUATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; protested Helen vehemently. &ldquo;You shall not give the envelope to
      Margaret&mdash;you must not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mine,&rdquo; insisted the widow with equal vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo; Kent withheld the envelope from both women. &ldquo;Will you
      tell me the contents of this envelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; curtly. &ldquo;It is not your affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my affair,&rdquo; retorted Kent with equally shortness of manner. &ldquo;I
      insist on an answer to my questions in the limousine this morning. How
      came your handkerchief in Jimmie's possession, and why did you go to the
      police court and, yet keep your presence there a secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie must have picked up the handkerchief when in the McIntyre house,&rdquo;
       she answered sullenly. &ldquo;I presume he forgot to provide him self with one
      in his make-up as burglar. As regards your second question I admit I did
      go to the police court out of curiosity&mdash;I wanted to find out what
      was going on. You,&rdquo; with a resentful glance at Helen, &ldquo;treated me as an
      outsider, and I was determined to find out for myself how the burglar
      farce would end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you term it a farce&mdash;is that why you laughed in court?&rdquo; asked
      Kent quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster changed color. &ldquo;I feel badly about that,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;I
      meant no disrespect to Jimmie, but I have a nervous inclination to laugh&mdash;almost
      hysteria&mdash;when excited and overwrought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; answered Kent slowly. He was distinctly puzzled; Mrs. Brewster's
      air of candor disarmed suspicion, but&mdash;&ldquo;You saw and talked with
      Jimmie Turnbull on Monday night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo; Her denial was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how did you learn of his arrest?&rdquo; asked Kent swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I overheard him conversing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo; Kent demanded eagerly as she paused as if to reconsider her
      confidences. Helen, one hand on the desk and the other on the arm of her
      chair, tried to rise, but her strength had deserted her. &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;
       repeated Kent as the widow remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie was talking with Grimes,&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster stated slowly. &ldquo;From what
      I overheard, he paid Grimes to let him inside the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked perplexed as he gazed first at the widow and then at Helen,
      who had sunk back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Brewster,&rdquo; he began after a pause. &ldquo;Who gave Jimmie your aconitine
      pills which Grimes left on the hall table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The murderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo; Kent was watching her closely and he detected the tiny
      beads of perspiration which were gathering on her upper lip. &ldquo;And who, in
      your opinion, was the murderer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster's expression changed&mdash;she looked hunted, and her eyes
      fell before Kent's; abruptly she turned her back on him, to find Colonel
      McIntyre at her elbow and Barbara just entering the room. Her eyes
      traveled past the girl until they rested on Philip Rochester and Detective
      Ferguson hovering behind him. Her face altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Philip Rochester,&rdquo; pointing dramatically toward him, &ldquo;crawl out of
      the reception room window and dart into the street just as O'Ryan came in
      the front door with Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Detective Ferguson could not restrain a joyful exclamation. &ldquo;So that was
      it!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You were at the McIntyre house, and gave the poison to
      Turnbull there&mdash;and not in the court room&mdash;four hours before he
      died. You'll swing for that crime, my buck, in spite of your glib tongue
      and slippery ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he ceased speaking Ferguson's ever ready handcuffs swung suggestively
      from his hand, but Helen's agonized cry checked his approach toward
      Rochester, who stood stolidly waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! You cannot permit this monstrous injustice, Philip shall not
      suffer for another. No, Barbara,&rdquo; as her sister strove to quiet her, &ldquo;we
      must tell the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I tell it for Colonel McIntyre,&rdquo; Rochester advanced as the door
      opened and Sylvester ushered in Benjamin Clymer. &ldquo;You have come in time,
      Clymer,&rdquo; his voice deepened, the voice of a man accustomed to present a
      case and sway a court. &ldquo;Wait, Sylvester, sit at that table and take down
      these charges&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charges?&rdquo; questioned Kent, watching his partner narrowly; he tossed a
      stenographic pad to Sylvester and made a place for him at his desk. &ldquo;Go
      on, Rochester; charges against whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charges against the man who, occupying a position of trust, planned to
      swindle the Metropolis Trust Company through forged notes and checks,&rdquo;
       Rochester stated with slow emphasis. &ldquo;Jimmie Turnbull learned that you,
      Clymer, were to visit Colonel McIntyre on Monday night, and he went there
      in disguise to find out if his suspicions were correct. The investigation
      cost him his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clymer, who had followed Rochester's statement, first with bewilderment
      and then with rising wrath, found his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You drunken scoundrel!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dare!&rdquo; Rochester laughed recklessly. &ldquo;Jimmie kept his wits to the last;
      his mind was clear; he recognized you in the prisoner's pen and he tried
      to call you, but his palsied tongue could not say Ben, but stuttered&mdash;B&mdash;b&mdash;b.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he wish to tell me?&rdquo; gasped Clymer, down whose colorless
      face perspiration trickled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, what?&rdquo; broke in Kent significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie may not have gotten the information he wished at your house,
      Colonel McIntyre, but his presence there on Monday night showed the forger
      he was in danger, and like the human snake he is, he poisoned without
      warning. Don't move&mdash;Sylvester!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a backward spring Kent caught his clerk as he sped for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make any mistake in putting on the handcuffs this time, Ferguson,&rdquo;
       he shouted. &ldquo;A forger and a contortionist make a bad customer to reckon
      with.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THE RIDDLE ANSWERED
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was absolute stillness in the room; then a babble of exclamations
      broke out as Sylvester, his expression of dumb surprise giving place to
      one of fury, struggled to free himself from the detective's firm grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot escape, Sylvester,&rdquo; declared Kent, observing his efforts.
      &ldquo;Your carelessness in using your peculiar gift of penmanship in copying
      Barbara McIntyre's signature in this memorandum of her visit here&rdquo;&mdash;Kent
      held up a sheet torn from his pad, &ldquo;gave me the first clew. These, the
      second,&rdquo; he showed several pieces of blotting paper freshly used. &ldquo;See, in
      the mirror here is reflected the impression from your clever imitations of
      the handwritings of Barbara, Colonel McIntyre, and Mrs. Brewster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crowded about Kent, all but Ferguson and his prisoner, who had
      subsided in his chair with what the detective concluded was dangerous
      quietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My next step, now that suspicion was directed against Sylvester, was to
      make personal inquiries regarding him,&rdquo; went on Kent. &ldquo;Judge Hildebrand,
      who had just returned to Washington, said that he first met Sylvester at a
      circus sideshow where he gave exhibitions as a contortionist. One of his
      special stunts was to slip out of handcuffs and ropes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that explains last night,&rdquo; Ferguson grinned. &ldquo;You'll not do it again,
      Sylvester,&rdquo; and he shook an admonitory finger at the erstwhile clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Hildebrand became interested in Sylvester, found he was handy with
      his pen and tired of the show business, and gave him an opening by
      engaging him as confidential clerk,&rdquo; continued Kent. &ldquo;You will recall,
      Colonel McIntyre, that you sent business papers in your handwriting and
      that of your daughters to Judge Hildebrand's office to be typed by his
      staff. That is how Sylvester became so well acquainted with your writing
      and was able to forge a letter to the bank treasurer directing him to turn
      over your negotiable securities to Jimmie Turnbull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how in the world did Sylvester induce Jimmie to present the forged
      letter?&rdquo; asked Colonel McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned to the sullen prisoner. &ldquo;Answer that question, Sylvester,&rdquo; he
      commanded, and the man roused himself from his dejected attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything in it for me if I do?&rdquo; he asked with a cunning leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's for the courts to decide,&rdquo; declared Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man thought a minute. &ldquo;I'll take a chance,&rdquo; he said finally. &ldquo;But that
      I waited for an opportunity to get my swag out of this safe, I wouldn't
      have been caught&mdash;curse you!&rdquo; and he scowled at Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut that out,&rdquo; admonished Ferguson with a none too gentle dig in the
      ribs, and Sylvester continued his statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I overheard Colonel McIntyre tell Judge Hildebrand about his securities
      and their present value, and the next day he came to consult the judge
      about engaging a secretary. I fixed up credentials and went to Mr.
      Turnbull; he believed my story that I was the colonel's new secretary and
      got the securities.&rdquo; Sylvester paused. &ldquo;If I'd rested content with that
      success I'd been all right,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;But I was in too great a hurry and
      forged Mr. Clymer's signature to a check for five thousand dollars and
      presented it at the Metropolis Trust Company. As luck would have it Mr.
      Turnbull cashed it for me himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn't he suspect you?&rdquo; exclaimed Clymer. He had gradually recovered
      from the shock of Rochester's charges on his arrival, and was listening
      with keen attention to Sylvester's confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I made the check payable to Colonel McIntyre and forged his
      endorsement,&rdquo; Sylvester spoke with an air of pride, and he smiled in
      malicious enjoyment as, catching his eye, Barbara shrank back and
      sheltered herself behind Kent. &ldquo;Mr. Turnbull accepted the check; later
      something must have aroused his suspicions, and I found when he questioned
      me that he believed Colonel McIntyre had forged the check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! You let him think that?&rdquo; gasped McIntyre; then wrath gained
      the mastery. &ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I encouraged him to think it,&rdquo; Sylvester grinned again. &ldquo;You must
      have handed Mr. Turnbull a raw deal; he was so ready to think evil of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a lie!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen hotly. &ldquo;When I went downstairs to
      investigate the noise I heard in the library, father, Jimmie told me who
      he was to quiet my fright. He showed me a letter, which he had just found
      on your desk in the library, confessing that you had forged Mr. Clymer's
      name on the check, and begging Jimmie to conceal your crime and save
      Barbara and me from the shame of having you exposed as a forger and a
      thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never wrote such a letter!&rdquo; shouted McIntyre, deeply incensed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was a clever plan,&rdquo; acknowledged Sylvester. &ldquo;On one of my trips to
      your house, Colonel McIntyre, I secured wax impressions of your front door
      lock. I went to your house Monday night and put the letter among your
      papers just before Turnbull was admitted by your fool of a butler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you gave Jimmie Turnbull a dose of poison&mdash;charged Kent, but
      Sylvester, his lips gone dry, raised his manacled hands in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not poison him,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I waited just to see if Turnbull got
      the letter and to find out what he'd do with the securities, which he had
      refused to turn over to me. After he had read the forged letter Mr.
      Turnbull acted sort of faint and went out in the hall. I could just see
      him put down a box on the hall table and lean against the wall. Then he
      went into the dining room and came back a second later carrying a glass of
      water, and I saw him take up and open a small box and toss some white
      pills into his mouth; then he took a good drink, and, picking up a
      handkerchief lying on the table, he went back into the library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence as Sylvester's callous recital of the tragedy ended.
      Helen, her eyes tearless and dark with suffering, sank slowly back in her
      chair and rested her head against Barbara's sympathetic shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Turnbull's death was accidental after all,&rdquo; exclaimed Ferguson. &ldquo;Or
      was it suicide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accident,&rdquo; answered Kent. &ldquo;I found some nitro-glycerine pills in the
      umbrella stand by the hall table.&rdquo; Colonel McIntyre nodded. &ldquo;Evidently
      Turnbull put down his pill box before getting a glass of water, and in his
      attack of giddiness accidentally opened your box of aconitine pills, Mrs.
      Brewster, instead of his own, and swallowed a fatal dose, thinking they
      were nitroglycerine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brewster bowed her head in agreement. &ldquo;That must have been it,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;However, I saw Colonel McIntyre tear off the paper wrapping and
      open my package of pills just before dinner, and when I heard that Jimmie
      had died from aconitine I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered and stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You suspected I had murdered him?&rdquo; asked McIntyre softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she looked appealingly at him. &ldquo;Forgive me, I should never have
      suspected you, but the pills, box and all, were missing the next morning
      from the hall table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turnbull must have thrown the box into the umbrella stand,&rdquo; explained
      Kent. &ldquo;That was where I found it. Did you get the securities, Sylvester?&rdquo;
       turning to the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; sullenly. &ldquo;She did,&rdquo; and a jerk of his thumb indicated Helen
      McIntyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Helen raised her head and addressed them slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie and I expected Barbara to come in at any moment, and he started to
      leave when we saw you coming downstairs,&rdquo; she turned to Mrs. Brewster.
      &ldquo;Jimmie declared that if we were found together I might be compromised. He
      couldn't explain his presence without exposing father&mdash;we both
      thought you a forger, father,&rdquo; she interpolated, as McIntyre took her hand
      and pressed it understandingly. &ldquo;So he insisted that I should treat him
      like an ordinary burglar&mdash;we had both forgotten Barbara's silly wager
      in our horror about father. Jimmie didn't dare take the securities and
      father's confession with him for fear he'd be searched at the police
      station, and the scandal would have come out then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; agreed McIntyre. &ldquo;Go on, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Jimmie thrust the securities and father's confession into an envelope
      and sealed it with red wax, using Barbara's seal,&rdquo; explained Helen. &ldquo;He
      hadn't time to write an address or message on it, but he told me to return
      the envelope to him later in the day or give it to Philip Rochester and
      ask his aid. I brought it here on Wednesday morning and with Harry's
      permission put the envelope in the safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to get it from there,&rdquo; volunteered Sylvester, &ldquo;for I overheard
      Turnbull's plan, before I left by the reception room window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was you and not Mr. Rochester whom I saw steal out of the window,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mrs. Brewster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not the first time I've been mistaken for him,&rdquo; exclaimed Sylvester
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent started and, gazing at Rochester and the clerk, saw there was a
      general resemblance in coloring and physique.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you present the checks to McDonald at the Metropolis Trust Company
      bearing Rochester's and my forged signatures?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; acknowledged Sylvester. &ldquo;Mr. Rochester's wardrobe came in very
      handy for deceiving the casual glance. You know, 'clothes make the man,
      and want of it the fellow.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked up quickly, struck by an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sylvester, did you steal the envelope containing the securities from me
      at the Club de Vingt?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester shook his head. &ldquo;No, but she did,&rdquo; pointing to Mrs. Brewster.
      &ldquo;It's no lie,&rdquo; as McIntyre uttered an indignant denial. &ldquo;When Ferguson
      left here carrying off the securities from under my nose almost&mdash;I
      had spent the whole day trying to learn the safe's combination; I trailed
      him to the Club de Vingt, and heard the head waiter tell him you, Mr.
      Kent, were sitting in the small smoking porch, so I climbed up the trumpet
      vine; oh, it was strong and no climb for one who has done the feats I have
      in the circus. I reached the porch just in time to see Mrs. Brewster drop
      her fan, and when the men bent to pick it up she 'lifted' the envelope and
      concealed it under her scarf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; Mrs. Brewster laid a detaining hand on McIntyre as he stepped
      forward. &ldquo;The man is telling the truth. I thought it was the envelope you
      gave me earlier in the evening&mdash;it was unaddressed and the red seal
      was the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; interrupted Kent. &ldquo;What did you do with the envelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I returned home I dropped it inside one of the Venetian caskets,&rdquo;
       Mrs. Brewster replied. &ldquo;No one ever went near them, and I thought it would
      be safe there. You see, I was puzzled to know how it had disappeared from
      the desk in the reception room, where I had left it in one of the pigeon
      holes, intending to take it later to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the envelope&mdash;your envelope&mdash;out of the desk,&rdquo; confessed
      McIntyre. &ldquo;I would have spoken of it, Margaret, but was hurt that you had
      left our marriage certificate lying around so carelessly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your what?&rdquo; Barbara sprang up, astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our marriage certificate,&rdquo; repeated McIntyre firmly. &ldquo;Margaret and I were
      married last week in Baltimore. We would have told you, Helen, but your
      peculiar conduct and Barbara's, so angered me that I forbade Margaret to
      take you into our confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Barbara got no further, for Helen had risen. She spoke with
      quiet dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, father, that since Monday night we have thought you a forger
      and, worse, a murderer,&rdquo; her voice faltered. &ldquo;In our effort to guard you
      we have become estranged. Margaret&rdquo;&mdash;she held out her hand with an
      affectionate gesture and with a sob her step-mother kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did this envelope get back inside our safe?&rdquo; asked Kent a moment
      later, picking it up and displaying the red seal, intact save for the
      broken corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went downstairs about midnight or a little later and into the library,&rdquo;
       confessed Helen. &ldquo;What was my surprise and terror to see Grimes holding
      the envelope. To me it meant father's exposure as a forger. I had a
      revolver in my hand and struck before I thought. Then I must temporarily
      have lost my reason. It was only my thought to save father that lent me
      courage and strength to thrust Grimes inside the casket where Babs and I
      used to hide. I then returned to my room, and was just coming downstairs
      again after secreting the envelope, to release Grimes and get medical
      assistance if need be, when Margaret's screams aroused the household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McIntyre interrupted his daughter with a hasty gesture, and addressed his
      wife. &ldquo;When Detective Ferguson questioned me as to your reason for being
      in the library, Margaret, I stated you had gone down to get a book left
      lying on the Venetian casket,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I waited for you to volunteer an
      explanation of your presence there, but you never made any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went down to get our marriage certificate.&rdquo; Margaret forgot the
      presence of others and spoke only to him, the love-light in her eyes
      pleading against the censure she dreaded, as she made her brief
      confession. &ldquo;Mr. Clymer sent me a note, inclosing a canceled check,
      stating the bank officials had decided my signature was a forgery. The
      check was drawn to Barbara, and on examining it I noticed the peculiar
      formation of the letter 'B'; it is characteristic of your handwriting and
      Helen's.&rdquo; She paused, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at a loss what to think. I knew you and Helen wrote alike; Helen's
      extraordinary behavior to me led me to believe that perhaps she had been
      short of funds, and forged my name to a check in desperation. Then I
      remembered seeing you, Charles, open the box containing my aconitine
      pills, the box's disappearance, and Jimmie's death from that poison&rdquo;&mdash;she
      raised her hands in an expressive gesture. &ldquo;Although my reason told me
      that you might be guilty, my loyalty and love refuted the accusation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; McIntyre's voice shook with emotion; then controlling himself
      he turned to Sylvester. &ldquo;I presume this check was some more of your
      deviltry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen answered for the clerk. Removing a soiled paper from her bag she
      laid it on Kent's desk. &ldquo;This note was handed to me by Grimes,&rdquo; she
      explained. &ldquo;It reads: 'Helen, please cash this check and give money to
      Mrs. Brewster's dressmaker. Father.' I followed the instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And gave the money to my sister,&rdquo; Sylvester chuckled at their surprise.
      &ldquo;My sister was taught in a French convent, and she is an excellent
      seamstress, when she isn't drunk, as Mrs. McIntyre knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Sylvester,&rdquo; Clymer broke his long silence. &ldquo;You were in the
      police court on a charge of assault and battery brought by your wife on
      Tuesday morning, and you were in the prisoner's cage at the moment
      Turnbull died. How then was it possible for you to be at the McIntyre's at
      midnight on Monday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was out on bail and appeared in the courtroom just in time for my
      trial,&rdquo; Sylvester explained. &ldquo;I did not have to sit in the cage, but
      recognizing Turnbull I went there to be with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent placed the forged check bearing Margaret Brewster's signature on the
      desk. &ldquo;I take it this check is your work, Sylvester,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You reaped
      the benefit by having the money paid to your sister. Did you also have the
      fake telegram delivered to me stating Mr. Rochester was in Cleveland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I faked that,&rdquo; broke in Rochester, before the clerk could make a
      disclaimer. &ldquo;I thought it best to disappear for a few days down in
      Virginia, where I could think things over in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was you, Sylvester, and not Mr. Rochester whom I encountered in his
      apartment,&rdquo; exclaimed Kent. &ldquo;How did you get in the apartment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the fire-escape and along the window ledge to the bathroom window.&rdquo;
       Sylvester hitched his shoulders. &ldquo;It was nothing for a man of my agility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferguson eyed him with doubtful respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have courage,&rdquo; he admitted grudgingly. &ldquo;Come, we must get to
      Headquarters,&rdquo; and he aided Sylvester to his feet, but once standing,
      Sylvester refused to move. Instead he turned to Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that you passed to Mr. Rochester in the police court and he
      later gave to Mr. Turnbull?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Oh, don't deny it, I saw you palm
      a note, Mr. Rochester, from the young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing now to conceal,&rdquo; declared Helen. &ldquo;After O'Ryan and
      Jimmie left the house for the police station I grew fearful that Jimmie
      might over-tax his strength in carrying out the farce of his arrest. So as
      soon as I could I telephoned to Philip to meet me at the police court and
      to bring some amyl nitrite capsules with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the note, Sylvester, which you saw Miss McIntyre give me in court,&rdquo;
       concluded Rochester, as Helen paused, &ldquo;told me to hand the capsules to the
      burglar and to defend him in court. I did both, although badly puzzled by
      the request.&rdquo; Rochester hesitated. &ldquo;I carried out your wishes, Helen,
      without question; but when the burglar's identity was revealed, I jumped
      to the conclusion that you had used me as an instrument to kill him, for I
      knew something of the effects of amyl nitrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rochester looked at her and bit his lip; he knew of her affection for
      Jimmie and her attachment to his memory, but he could not kill the hope
      that when Time had healed the loss, his devotion might some day win her
      for his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did you great injustice,&rdquo; he admitted humbly. &ldquo;But I was fearfully
      shocked by the scene. I strove to divert suspicion by insisting that
      Jimmie died from angina pectoris, and then you came, Helen, and demanded
      an autopsy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to,&rdquo; Helen broke in. &ldquo;I could not believe that Jimmie's death was
      due to natural causes,&rdquo; her voice quivered. &ldquo;He had been so loyal&mdash;so
      faithful&mdash;I could not be less true to him, even if, as I feared, my
      own dear father was guilty of the crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned and faced Sylvester, who had made a few shuffling steps toward
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done incalculable harm by your criminal acts,&rdquo; he said sternly.
      &ldquo;But for your lying and trickery Jimmie Turnbull would be alive to-day. I
      trust the Court will give you the maximum sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sylvester eyed him insolently. &ldquo;I've had a run for my money, and I stood
      to win large sums if things had only gone right,&rdquo; he announced; then
      addressed Helen directly. &ldquo;What did you do with the securities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put the envelope back in the open safe when I was here early this
      afternoon,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      An oath ripped from Sylvester. &ldquo;I mistook you for your sister,&rdquo; he
      snarled. &ldquo;Had I known it was you, I'd have wrung the securities from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen stared at his suddenly contorted face. &ldquo;Ah, you are the man who
      looked in at the window of the reception room yesterday morning when I was
      talking to Mr. Kent,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I recognize you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued to glare at her. &ldquo;I also sent you a note by your sister
      outside the Cafe St. Marks to secrete the letter 'B',&rdquo; his voice rose
      almost into a shout in his ungovernable rage. &ldquo;I heard Turnbull tell you
      to take the envelope to Rochester, and I banked on your bringing it here
      or to his apartment. D-mn you! You've thwarted me at every turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rochester's powerful hand was clapped across his mouth with such force
      that the clerk staggered against Ferguson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you, out you go.&rdquo; The detective shoved the struggling man toward the
      door leading into the corridor and Clymer sprang to his assistance; a
      second later Rochester closed the door on their receding figures and found
      Helen standing by his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said, turning back to look at her father and his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo; Kent held up an envelope with its fateful red seal. &ldquo;This
      was delivered empty at Rochester's apartment last night&mdash;it is
      addressed to him. Who wrote it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. McIntyre. &ldquo;I felt I must consult either you, Mr.
      Kent, or Mr. Rochester, so I sent the note to his apartment, but the
      messenger boy hurried me, and it was not until hours later that I found
      the note lying on the desk in the reception room and realized I had sent
      an empty envelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Kent held up another envelope, the red seal broken at the corner.
      &ldquo;This is yours, Helen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Helen hesitated perceptibly before taking the envelope and tearing it
      open. She handed the securities to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is father's forged confession,&rdquo; she said as she took the remaining
      paper from the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a marvelous imitation of my handwriting,&rdquo; declared McIntyre,
      looking at it carefully, then tearing it into tiny bits he flung them into
      the scrap-basket and pocketed the securities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think that I aided Sylvester's plot to gain the securities by
      engaging him as our clerk,&rdquo; groaned Rochester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was clever of him to seek employment here,&rdquo; agreed Kent. &ldquo;But like
      many crooks he over-reached himself through over-confidence. Must you go,
      Colonel McIntyre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; McIntyre walked over to Helen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear little girl,&rdquo; he began and his voice was husky with feeling. &ldquo;How
      can I show my appreciation of your loyalty to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By being kind to Harry and Barbara.&rdquo; Helen smiled bravely, although her
      lips were trembling and for a moment she could not trust herself to speak.
      &ldquo;My romance is over; Barbara's is just beginning. And, father, will you
      and Margaret come home with me&mdash;I am so lonely;&rdquo; then turning blindly
      away she fairly ran out of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go with her,&rdquo; said Rochester, a trifle unsteadily. &ldquo;It has been a
      terrible ordeal; God help her to forget!&rdquo; His voice failed and he swept
      his hand across his eyes as he held open the door into the corridor and
      followed McIntyre and his wife outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned impulsively to Barbara, and his arms closed around her as she
      raised her eyes to meet his, for she knew that the promise they spoke
      would be loyally fulfilled, and that her haven of love and happiness was
      reached at last.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
